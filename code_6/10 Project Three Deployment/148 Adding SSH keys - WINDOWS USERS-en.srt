1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,890
OK so now we're going to be doing is adding S-sh keys to our computer.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,420
So if you're asking yourself why we could we need to add a set of keys.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,030
Well if you think about this you're sending files to the cloud.

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,250
So it's always a good idea to have kind of an indication or something in between that you know it's

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,810
a little bit more secure.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,820
All right.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,440
So this is what we're going to be doing now.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:36,430
If you go to your profile I'm going to go to the profile and just let me show you right here instead

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,470
of the profile going to go to settings actually settings.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,070
You get a bunch of options.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,530
And if I go to S-sh keys right here to answer say and GBG you're going to get a list of a set of keys.

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,720
I get the Mac because I did the Mac Berio first and I've added the S-sh key right here.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,400
But now of course we're going to do the windows and for this we need a bunch of stuff we need to do

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,540
a few stuff.

15
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:05,100
Now first I need you to go to the to the browser and type adding a new SH key to get have a count.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,080
Actually not this one.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,180
I'm going to go to the other one.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,650
Let me go back.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,730
Type checking for an existing S-sh key.

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,470
If you check that on the browser and you get to get HAVE result go to go to get help.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,700
We're going to need this right.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,680
This is the first STARTING POINT.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,570
Now before we can move forward I'm going to tell you something after whenever you installed get by default

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,120
you get this option but whenever you can naggy says Windows Explorer integration get back here.

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,420
And we need to get Bash.

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,470
We need it.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,170
If you unclick that when you install this you will need to click it because we will need the bash.

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,870
We cannot do it without the bash.

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:54,520
So this bash story is kind of a simulation of a terminal that actually works for Linux because it would

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,940
be really complicated for us to do it with the normal command prompt to close it.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,740
And I'm going to say exit set up.

32
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,080
Yes and I have the right to it right here.

33
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,220
I get the the command prompt.

34
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,410
Let me see if I can make it bigger maybe a little bit.

35
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,070
There you go.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,970
OK.

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,950
So we're going to be using this in a minute.

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,870
So there we go.

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,090
Sorry for this.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,810
All right.

41
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,240
So if we go to the checking for existing SH keys right here we need to start.

42
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,550
So I'm going to copy this.

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,000
And again you cannot do copy paste because again is a simulation of a terminal.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,120
So I got a copy going to go back here and they're going to paste it.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,790
So by doing this you can go to the default place where we store S.H. keys and we're going to check if

46
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,540
we do have a case.

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,260
So I'm going to press enter and you going to get something like this.

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,530
If you get something saying have an ID RSA or something like that is because you already have keys.

49
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,400
So if that is the case you want need to go to this one and your sh key to the SH agent.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,930
If not you just move forward to generate a new S-sh key.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
And this is what we are going to be doing.

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,560
OK.

53
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,490
So this is the first step.

54
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,920
I'm going to copy this just like we did before.

55
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,770
Can it command copy are going to go here and I'm going to I'm going to paste it with paste so we are

56
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,440
going to be you know adding creating an SH key and you need to put the password or your email and this

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,510
isn't going to be using of course the e-mail.

58
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,270
What I'm using for the Get Help account.

59
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,330
So it's just like this.

60
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,960
I was done that come.

61
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,450
All right.

62
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,520
So I'm going to press enter and the Keys are you know kind of already done but it's going to ask you

63
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,440
Do you want to save it in the default place.

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,870
Or maybe a different place.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,740
Well default place so I'm going to press press enter and that's it.

66
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,590
You have the ability to enter passphrase for this.

67
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,090
I'm not going to carry the passphrase.

68
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm just going to press enter and then it's going to go to default.

69
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,900
Now if you're getting this it's because the data key was generated.

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,970
Now if I go to the previous command and pressing the up arrow and do ls to check if I have keys can

71
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,690
press enter.

72
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,900
And now we get it we have to get the ID say an ID pup.

73
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,380
So you know this is this part it's kind of ready.

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,980
We have the keys right here.

75
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,630
Now what we need to do we need to add the SH key to the estate agent.

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,120
So I'm going to copy this in a copy.

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,950
I can go back to the bash and paste it right in a press center.

78
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,360
And if you're getting this done then we need to go to the other command.

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:42,220
This one I'm going to copy paste and enter an identity at it.

80
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,960
So it's kind of I'm making a link between the key and you know your computer.

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,430
All right.

82
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,020
So the next step and the key to your get have account and this one is pretty pretty simple.

83
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:59,520
So I'm going to copy this line and are going to paste it right here Paiste are going to press enter

84
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,170
it.

85
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,660
So whenever the press center seems like nothing happened.

86
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:10,010
So basically with clip and side windows you know we are just copying all the contents of this file right.

87
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,620
We are just copying all of this.

88
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,120
So now we need to go to get help.

89
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,730
So we're going to go new S-sh key just like this and I'm going to say Windows right here because I mean

90
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,760
my windows computer and I get to go here and I'm going to do a command and paste all the cum all the

91
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,800
contents which is copied from the command and it's pasting pretty much spacing all the contents we have

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,510
on that file.

93
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,420
And that is that I'm going to add as a search key.

94
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,140
And we're pretty much done.

95
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,220
Now I'm going to try to validate this so I'm going to do.

96
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm going to go to the command.

97
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,560
There is no copying pasting right here.

98
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,260
So I'm going to do.

99
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,080
S S H that minus capital T space.

100
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,260
Get at get have that come just like that.

101
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,530
I'm going to press enter.

102
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,170
And is going to say hi your username you're successfully authenticated.

103
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,750
So pretty much of this command what it's doing is just validating all your your kids ride with get have.

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,040
So now if I go here and reload the application it's not in black anymore it's going to be in green.

105
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,740
It means that everything was validated.

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,580
So you're ready to use using SH keys.

107
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,220
All right.

108
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,590
So that is good if you are at this point.

109
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,660
Everything going OK.

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,730
So we can move forward to the next thing.

111
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,160
So the next thing it's going to be go into Heroku installing everything and kind of a link.

112
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,920
This is a key again.

113
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,320
But with Heroku.

114
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,160
And if you're maybe you are thinking oh we need to do all this commands again.

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,180
Well not really.

116
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,600
We're getting with the Heroku.

117
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,950
It's really real simple.

118
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,220
It's pretty much.

119
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,140
We just installed and that's it.

120
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,700
So let's go to the next one and go to Hiroko.

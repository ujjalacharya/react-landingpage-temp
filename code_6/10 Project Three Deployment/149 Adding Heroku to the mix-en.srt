1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,700
OK so now we need to create or to actually to do the Heroku side of things.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,120
We did it would get have.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,880
So now we need to do it with Heroku we need to grab that SH and link it to Hoku.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,340
Right.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,920
OK.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,180
So the first thing you will need to do is to go to Heroku of course and create an account.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,010
Right.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,010
Of course.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:27,160
So after you create your account and please remember your username which is the email and the password

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,750
because we can use it right here it's going to take you to go to the dashboard and you get to get something

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,550
like this.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,490
You're right.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,250
This is OK.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,340
This is actually starting point.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,960
So now in order to use or to actually send our project or deploy the project from here from our terminal

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:52,980
to Heroku you will need to install the Heroku CLIA of course go go to the browser and do Heroku.

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,410
I like that.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,290
And the first option you get is this one right.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,540
So enter there's this one.

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,340
So if you go to download and install you get to you can get a bunch of options to install.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:10,860
You can do it from a homebrew or whatever of course but you will need to download the installer so download

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,880
the installer for Mac OSX or do it with homebrew.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,790
If you know how to and if you're a Windows computer download the installer are going to of course and

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,040
you get Ubuntu of course are going to download the installer right now and i've already have it installed

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,970
in my computer.

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,060
Got it but again installed anyways so I'm going to download and I'll be right back.

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,580
All right so I'm going to open it and install it again.

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,600
So of course resemble continue then continue.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,760
That of course continue.

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,160
And then again with the password of course maybe for Windows you going to get the run as administrator.

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,160
Some like that but that is OK.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,070
So almost done right.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,650
After everything is installed of course we need to we need a way to check that Heroku was installed

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,620
so we're going to do Heroku minus minus help.

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,990
So when you do this is going to give you all the you know all the commands we get Bogdanovic we have

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,360
all of it we get.

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,770
Available with the Heroku Seelye.

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,370
Right of course we are not going to use all of this are going to be clear.

39
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,500
Of course if you're getting this this help it's because it was installed.

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,570
If you're not getting this you need to restart the computer.

41
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:31,130
All right so now we have left Heroku in our computer so we need to log in or there to deploy our project.

42
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:38,440
So how we log in Heroku and then log in are going to press center is going to ask you for your username

43
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,900
so gonna do.

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,210
I'm going to put mine it was done.

45
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,240
It's one of my email accounts I have a lot.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,360
And then of course the password I can log in and of course logged in as your username.

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,910
Right.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm going to do a clip just like that would get have.

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,160
We need to grab that S-sh key remember and associate that key with Heroku.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,860
And remember that would get have was you know we when we needed to do a lot of things well with Hiroko

51
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
it's really really simple.

52
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:20,460
So Heroku going to say keys Cohen and then at going to press enter and I would magically is going to

53
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,790
go to the public folder where we get the you know we store the S.H. keys and you know tells us that

54
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,900
I've found one tree and use that one.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,430
Well we're going to say yes and that's it.

56
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,270
That's pretty much the only thing we need to do.

57
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,940
The last step would be associating this.

58
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,400
So we do S-sh just like we did before.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:49,560
S-sh minus the space we do get at Heroku dot com.

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,710
I'm going to press enter.

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,950
It's going to do a bunch of stuff and then it's going to say authentication and right here and we find

62
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,880
it offensive cations succeeded.

63
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,370
And that is it.

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,220
This is the only thing we need to do to link Heroku with you know our project and our computer.

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,810
So on the next section we're going to now do configuration.

66
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,690
But before we deploy we need to make a few changes in our project.

67
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,540
First we need to deploy a project then we need to go to the Heroku dashboard add the database we need

68
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,980
to do some configuration right here.

69
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:31,140
And of course we need to change something inside our project because this one if you remember when teachers

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,610
go to the package that owns this one works on a development environment.

71
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,290
If we send this to production nothing is going to really happen is not really work.

72
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,160
So we need to make a few changes on the package that J-Zone we need to make a few changes on the server.

73
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,400
We need to instruct server that you know it needs to use the index of this build.

74
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,320
Remember we're going to create a build well in it.

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,750
We need to actually let the server know that that's the file we want to use and not this one.

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,350
All right.

77
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,940
OK.

78
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,300
So let's go to the next section and start with all the configuration.

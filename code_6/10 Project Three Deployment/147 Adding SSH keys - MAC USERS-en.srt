1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,050
Right.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:07,640
So now that everything is inside you know get and get have what we will do will do.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,780
It's at S-sh keys.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,930
So again if we think about this we are kind of sending things to you know our files our rent maybe maybe

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,150
very private files to the cloud.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:27,290
And it's you know a good idea to add some kind of authentication or maybe some security in what we are

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,320
doing and this.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,080
It's through S-sh case.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,760
So if you go to your profile and you go to S-sh keys you can generate an SH key.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,640
Now the problem is that we need to create these keys in our computer.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,410
We create the keys locally.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:42,990
Right.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,640
OK.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,950
So we're willing to do is we need to follow a series of steps right.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:56,360
To generate the keys first in our computer and then associate associate the keys to get help Brian.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:56,790
OK.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:04,160
So the starting point is going to be this go to Google and type checking for existing S-sh keys.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,820
This is the first thing we need to do.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,820
So once you're here you're going to get different options.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,540
Mac Windows and Linux.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,780
Now if you're a Windows computer go to the other BDO have another video for the same action.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,800
That of course is related to windows because we need to do some other stuff we do in a different way

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,550
for Mac.

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,610
So go to the windows.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,100
Right.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,160
If you're on a Mac computer use Mac of course and going to do both.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,080
So right here if you're not getting anything nothing is associated to your search.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,410
So we need to do this.

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,380
Copy this this code and go right here and paste it right.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,700
Doesn't matter I am inside waves because I'm using the tiller.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,310
So if we press Enter you're going to get some kind of information just like this.

32
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:57,090
Now if you're getting something that says Id something perve or ID areas are s a.

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,930
It means that you already have A.H. keys so you will need to go to add your S-sh key to the SSA agent

34
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,170
to begin to do this later.

35
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,690
So first we need to generate a key if you don't have a key and this is what we're going to do now.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,390
So we're not going to you know make this up I'm going to just show you the steps are going to follow

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,710
the steps and get help.

38
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,990
So generate a new message key.

39
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,690
All right.

40
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,160
So first we're going to go here and we need to generate the key.

41
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,920
So I'm going to copy this line of code I'm going to do clear.

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,030
It's actually actually is a command.

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,250
And we do sh t minus T whatever whatever.

44
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,160
And then you need to provide it need mail and e-mail.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,510
It's the e-mail you're using for get have are going to delete this one and going to put my e-mail.

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,100
So right.

47
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,850
Yeah.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,110
And Gmail that com.

49
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,640
OK.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,260
So I'm going to press enter and generate a public key and then it's going to say Enter file in which

51
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,110
you want to save the key so you have the option to store the key in a different place than you know

52
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,980
the usual.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,520
But but the one way or we're going to be storing by default I'm going to store it on the default place

54
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,850
I'm going to press enter.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,330
Now you have the ability to pad to enter passphrase for this I'm not going to do this I'm just going

56
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,620
to go default.

57
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,860
I'm going to press enter.

58
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,260
And then of course you need to confirm the passphrase.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm going to press enter.

60
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,380
Now if you're getting this it's because the key was already in it get it's generated in your computer.

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,190
So now if I do this.

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,930
LS And you know we check for the S.H. keys.

63
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,380
We get the ID say and the pup.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,140
So we have keys now.

65
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,670
Right.

66
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,370
Very good.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Let's go to the next step is going to be adding your sh key to the SSA agent.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Now I'm going to do clear just like this.

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,550
I'm going to copy this line of code.

70
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,700
This command actually.

71
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,990
And paste it.

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,670
Evil.

73
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,940
And then everything else.

74
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,110
So I'm going to press enter and it's going to say Agent P ID 4:7.

75
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,640
So if you're getting this good track I'm going to copy this one again as well and again paste it down

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,330
here.

77
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm going to press enter and we get the identity added right.

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,680
So we're kind of linking this computer to the SSA to key.

79
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,940
Right.

80
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,880
So the next step it's adding the S-sh key to get help.

81
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,240
All right.

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,980
So I'm going to go to that one.

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,170
How can we do it really is simple so we can accomplish this.

84
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,630
And again pasted right here.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,300
Now I'm going to press enter and it seems like nothing happened.

86
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,600
And it's because the PV copy it's a command that it's entering this file copying all the constants and

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,200
everything you know got copied on the memory of the computer.

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,000
So now of course if I do a command and B to paste it.

89
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,980
Are going to be pasting the contents of this file.

90
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,210
So now what we need to do.

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,620
You need to follow these steps.

92
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,080
Don't worry you're going to do it right here.

93
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,640
So we need to go to to get help and go to the section inside the profile S-sh and deep keys and click

94
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,650
on new S-sh key.

95
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,940
You need to add a name.

96
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,310
For example if you're in your Mac computer you know that you're going to a Mac for example or maybe

97
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,530
you can you know give a name but of course this name needs to be related of where you're you know you're

98
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,020
storing.

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,680
You get this sh he's And this is my Mac computer.

100
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,700
Later I'm going to get a windows.

101
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,100
So I'm going to paste the contents control the end you're pasting all the contents of the same key.

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,720
Now I'm going to click Add a search key and we are pretty much done now of course we can and need a

103
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,460
way to validate the S-sh key we get right here in our computer with the one that it's linked and get

104
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,970
help.

105
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,980
So I'm going to go back to the command.

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,320
I'm going to do clear and I'm going to do as a sage just like that.

107
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:53,510
Mynahs capital-T space and then get at get have dot com of course.

108
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,190
All right.

109
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,820
So going to press Enter it's going to take a while and it is going to give you your username.

110
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,620
This is my username you know successfully authenticated but get have does not provide shared access.

111
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,530
Ok that is good.

112
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,260
You know if you're getting this everything work now if we go back here to get have a reload get a green

113
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,800
now.

114
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,400
So everything was validated.

115
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,050
Now the S.H. key is related to get have and we have a more secure way to send the files.

116
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,930
Of course this works just like before.

117
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,230
If I modify the file and go to get status we can get it.

118
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:38,850
So I'm going to get to get at that get commit minus them and then you know changes on index.

119
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,790
I'm going to press enter and then you push it again.

120
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,700
You know to push the files.

121
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,530
Usually we did get pushed master and this one since we already did this.

122
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,910
We can do get push because the Master is already there.

123
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,080
So I'm going to do get pushed

124
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,890
and we are done.

125
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,360
Everything is good.

126
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,510
So again once you get the keys you get get get get have and everything else you're ready to go to get

127
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,190
to Heroku link.

128
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,530
The same etch Etch a Sketch key but it can be much much easier.

129
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,990
And then we will be able to deploy to production.

130
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,270
All right.

131
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,940
So let's go to the next one and do that.

1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,550
Right.

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,630
So this couple of sections we're going to discuss in how to use get and how to use GET have now get

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,460
and get have are not the same thing.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,520
This one is get have.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,450
And the other one if I go to get just like this or in-style get the first option is going to be this

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,930
one so get and get help but are not related.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,350
And why are we using.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,700
Are we going to be using this once.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,800
It's because you always need to have a copy of repository of all your project.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,280
What happens if the computer is going of you know Dites dies on you and you know you pretty much lose

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,560
all your work you know very real dangers.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,860
Of course I have a different copy on a different you know instance of get of this project I have everything

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,990
saved saved on different places but of course on this one I've deleted everything.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:54,140
This project this is our project you know waves it's not really related to get or get help right.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:54,690
OK.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,300
So what I'm going to do I'm going to install get I'm going to show you how to use it.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,810
And then we're going to link get with get have going to generate S.H. keys and everything else are going

18
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,040
to tell you how to do it first.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,050
We do it to start with get right this is the first step.

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,460
So we need to download.

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,440
Of course if you're in Windows you're going to get the download for Windows.

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,850
But it's pretty much the same installer.

23
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,060
So first I'm going to download and now we're going to get this screen.

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,680
Sometimes you don't get the you know the out magic download.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,870
So click here to download manually.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,180
And it's going to take you to so two to Source Forge and you just you know you're going to get it of

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,050
course.

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,640
I've already have an install and it is going to download it anyways.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,070
Can take a second right.

30
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,570
I can open it all right to get the download I'm going to install it I'm going to click right click and

31
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,540
open because maybe you don't double click it on unmask at least it's not going to let you move move

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,080
forward.

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,010
So I'm going to click an open select Open and then you know are you sure.

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,440
Yeah.

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,710
We are sure open.

36
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,900
All right so you're going to get the screen instructions.

37
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,330
So we need to click Continue then you know the location that's ok install.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,840
And of course if it's asking for the password install software and everything else.

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,180
All right.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,210
So the installation was successful that that's OK.

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,290
So I'm going to close it and move to trash.

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,860
All right.

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,970
So I'll close it again.

44
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,670
Now how can you know.

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,090
How can we test in our computer if we you know we have a get installed right.

46
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,000
Because that's the first step checking.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,440
If you get insulted me go back to the previous version.

48
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:48,160
So this is the version maybe you know upgrade in mind because they have the 2 0 something.

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,900
OK.

50
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,680
So first I'm going to go here.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,090
We're going to go to our project.

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,390
I'm going to kill the server.

53
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm going to do it clear right.

54
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,710
So how can we check we get.

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,530
Well first we start with the command get and then minus minus and then version.

56
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,890
Now if you press enter you notice that this is the same one.

57
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,170
So if you're getting this it's because of course you have get in your computer if you're not getting

58
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,750
this it's because you need to restart the computer.

59
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,240
Right.

60
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,860
That's the first step and I believe that with Windows you will need to restart the computer.

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,440
And if you're just that you're asking yourself why most of developers they want to work with the Mac

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,660
or Linux based computers.

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,940
It's because of the terminal that is that's pretty much it.

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,800
I have both both things that have a Windows computer.

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,490
I use it for different things for music production.

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,320
And you know all of the things gaming and everything else.

67
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,430
But for Koning I just use the Mac.

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,980
I don't use anything else.

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,370
All right.

70
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,980
So now we have everything installed LEDs.

71
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,730
You know let's create a repository right here.

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,310
Right.

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,910
So I'm back in the project.

74
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,660
Let me make this a little bit smaller so so I'm back in the project k I'm going to do clear.

75
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,730
And now what we need to do we need to create and this is the keyboard a local repository inside our

76
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,410
computer.

77
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,520
Whenever we use good we are not storing anything in the cloud you're just creating a copy of our project

78
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,470
inside the same directory.

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,490
Notice I am inside waifs.

80
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,070
All right.

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,280
So how can we you know start a repository right here.

82
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,980
So far we don't have anything.

83
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:30,930
So the way we start a repository we do get because now we have it installed and then we do that now.

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,640
The Enter is going to say initialize empted get repository and it's going to give you the location and

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,690
then a directory called Dot get.

86
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,760
Now in this folder we don't get that get.

87
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,050
And of course if you navigate to this folder you might not be getting or seeing this folder.

88
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,510
This is a hidden folder and this directory contains all the data of your project.

89
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,870
After of course you store it right.

90
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,500
If you delete this folder locally in your computer you know this directory.

91
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,800
You can delete all the you know all the stored repository all the repository in your in your computer.

92
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,830
So you know don't do that unless of course you want to delete everything.

93
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,420
Right.

94
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:13,810
OK.

95
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,110
Now if I get in it again it's going to turn me reinitialized existing get reported repository.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,110
So I of course didn't do anything because we already get it.

97
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:30,420
Now if I do ls notice that I'm getting all the directories in all the files inside my inside this directory.

98
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,220
But I'm not getting anything else.

99
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,750
Now if I do ls minus a and this is for Mac minus a it's going to give me all the directories including

100
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
the you know the hidden ones.

101
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,560
In this case the does get or I'm going to do.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,320
Clear.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,740
How can we you know start things.

104
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,960
Well the first command you use with get it's get status.

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,590
So let me do it right here get status.

106
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,820
OK.

107
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,820
So the branch master it's you always the main branch.

108
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,740
What were you going to be storing all the files.

109
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,360
Like the main repository in the main part of use to your store right here.

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,820
Now when you do get status you're pretty much asking OK what is the status of my repository.

111
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,730
And it's going to give you two things.

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,270
First the untracked files and then later we're going to get something else saying no commits yet.

113
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,400
And this means that you know all these files are not store inside get.

114
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,490
So far we didn't get anything right.

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,360
So how can we you know start adding things inside get you know storing creating our repository with

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,660
the files we want.

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,230
Well the next command will be good.

118
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,620
And then at.

119
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,060
Now before we do it I'm going to tell you something else.

120
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,850
Remember that we have this get ignored.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,960
And we pretty much get to get ignore whenever we create our you know project with the CLID.

122
00:06:52,990 --> 00:07:00,440
Now the good ignore it's actually we use it with good to recognize old files or directories.

123
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,780
We don't want to store it.

124
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,230
Let me just do the following.

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,890
I'm going to just go back and of course we do get status and it's still looming.

126
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,410
OK.

127
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,870
So in your project Julians you'd have stored the ignore defined good ignore you don't have the client

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,010
for Slash because the client files Jason's you know the Jasons package server and you're in luck so

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,250
it's making a reference to everything but not the note modules right.

130
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,620
It's not telling me that I'm not getting the node modules and it's because we don't store the node modules

131
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,330
inside inside get.

132
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,420
You know it's are inside a repository or get help.

133
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:46,630
And it's because the node modules has a lot of files so there's no need to do this because whenever

134
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,890
we create a repository or actually we bring to a project from the server or move from Get have we've

135
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,610
already have the package adjacent.

136
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,600
So we do NPM or yarn in it and it will install all dependencies for us.

137
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,020
So we don't never never ever store the node modules and a good repository.

138
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,640
Right.

139
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,760
We never do that.

140
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,250
And the way we do that it's by specifying on the ignore what we want to skip.

141
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,180
So this is just a script file.

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,160
So we are saying that we don't want to store the Noj modules the node modules inside the client.

143
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,330
Remember we have node modules inside client and you know that that M-B the one we use for the server

144
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,130
and a bunch of stuff.

145
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,890
Now if I delete the node modules just like this and save the file and run that get started again we

146
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,600
get the node modules right.

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,330
So you always need to be aware of what you get inside to get ignored.

148
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,800
All right.

149
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:46,020
So going to a clear and going to go back with the node modules and again to do get started again and

150
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,830
now that getting the node modules that is okay.

151
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,770
So how can we add things.

152
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,060
Well there's two ways you have to get the ad than space and you can specify whatever is that you want

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,170
to store inside of the repository.

154
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,540
So I got to say Jason's.

155
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,360
And then for Slash I'm making a reference to this directory.

156
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,280
If I press Enter You know we go back to the branch and that is OK.

157
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:19,060
Now if I do get status it selling goes OK this one are inside the repository and the other ones you

158
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,500
know they are not.

159
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,100
So this would this way get Add in the name of what we want to add.

160
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,870
You're just adding things manually one by one.

161
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,350
Right.

162
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,080
OK.

163
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,280
Now the thing is that you know maybe you want to store everything that it's in your project and do it

164
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,780
by one by one.

165
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,090
Takes a lot of time.

166
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:43,210
So the way to do that it's to do get ad space and you put a dot and this will add everything that it's

167
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,380
not untracked.

168
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:53,640
Of course the all the untracked files in that local repository now and do clear if I do get status we're

169
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,390
going to get you know a list of all the files that you know were stored inside the local repository.

170
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,510
Now there is a difference between adding and committing you know there are different actions whenever

171
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,070
you add something.

172
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,680
It means that you're kind of adding to a to do list of get something right.

173
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,190
You're telling.

174
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,950
Ok I'm ready to store this files.

175
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,090
They are not stored inside and you and repository.

176
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,720
Right.

177
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,880
So it's kind of the get at creates a list of what you want to add right now.

178
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:36,030
Now to do really create a repository and add all these files into a local repo.

179
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,810
What you will need to do is just to run a different command and that one is commit.

180
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,900
So there is a difference between adding and committing.

181
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:52,350
So the way we commit we need to do get then commit space minus M and then we need to pass a message.

182
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,140
We need to tell to attach a message to this specific comment.

183
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,570
So on this one I'm going to say first commit and then we press enter.

184
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,790
It's going to do all of this in the middle clear.

185
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,700
And now if I do get status just like this you know we get nothing to commit.

186
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,370
Everything is good.

187
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:20,140
You know everything was set and inside a good store you know that get folder we get you know all everything

188
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,820
that we just committed which is pretty much the whole project.

189
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,660
That's why we don't get anything get status.

190
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,100
So what happens if I go to I don't know to the index I'm going to just modify one space save the file.

191
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,740
So now we made changes.

192
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:42,680
This index it's a little bit different than what with what we get inside the repository.

193
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,050
Right.

194
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,130
We have one more space.

195
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,970
Now of course we need to grab this file and store it again.

196
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,150
We need to update version.

197
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,570
So if I do get status it says OK.

198
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,310
So this file was modified it was modified and it's not inside your repository.

199
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,830
So you have a different portion of what we have in our repository.

200
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,920
So we just follow the same steps over and over again.

201
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,890
Good.

202
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,990
And you can pass the name of the file or you just do everything.

203
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,050
Then did you get the status and noticed that right here.

204
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,090
Now it's green.

205
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:30,270
Now we do get commit minus m minus M and then we pass the message which is under no changes on the index.

206
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,830
You always need to put a message that you know reflects the changes as they're going to press enter

207
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,620
and one file change.

208
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,910
Everything was good.

209
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,600
And if I do get started again we go back to nothing to commit you know everything it's up to date.

210
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,650
So this is a way how we use get right with our computer.

211
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:57,610
But again we are screeding to get the repository inside our computer if our computer just kind of breaks

212
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,160
or something happens with your computer.

213
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,720
You're going to lose everything because the repository it's local.

214
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,130
It's not on the cloud.

215
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,970
So the next step would be creating a get have account linking this good repository we have right here

216
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,850
in our computer with a get have account and upload files.

217
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,420
Right.

218
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,810
It's it's very simple let's do it right now.

219
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,400
OK so I am it and get help.

220
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,930
Of course you need to create an account then log in and of course you know the usual process when you

221
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,980
register or some planner form.

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,690
So inside get have you have two ways of doing things right.

223
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,940
One the first one it's free.

224
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,180
Right.

225
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,380
That's the first one.

226
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,630
And of course you can store repotted you can create repositories inside to get have and they are public

227
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,400
whenever you use a free account.

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,570
They are all public.

229
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,330
You can not create private repositories.

230
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:56,690
So once you upload this anyone has access to your files that's the first thing you need to know.

231
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,230
Of course if you want to of course have private repositories just like I do you know this ones are private.

232
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
You need to you know pay.

233
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,270
It's like five bucks a month maybe six or seven bucks.

234
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,260
It's real cheap.

235
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,640
Right.

236
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
And you can use it the whole time.

237
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,520
So once you have your account create it you can go to Home and click new repository or if you go to

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:26,570
your profile right here and you go to repositories you can create a new one right here.

239
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:34,040
So whenever you create new of course you're the owner and then you need to put the repository name right.

240
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,530
You can added scription.

241
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,440
And if it's a free account it's public or if it's your you have a pay account paid account.

242
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,550
You can go private.

243
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,440
That's OK.

244
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,330
So I'm going to select public and I'm going to create a repository.

245
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,860
All right.

246
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,330
Once you create the repository it's going to give you some instructions and it's going to say right

247
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,330
here the first one let's go to this one is going to say OK first you need to do get in it.

248
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,180
We kind of overdid this.

249
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,690
We need to add a re me.

250
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,100
So this is kind of a file where we can get instructions.

251
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,130
We didn't have a read me.

252
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,120
We just had get me inside the client but don't worry it's just a file with some instructions.

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,250
Then you need to do commed we kind of already did this and that get.

254
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,060
And this one is the one we need to do now.

255
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:28,180
You need to prompt a command to link the get repository we have right here in sideways with the you

256
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,220
know the location inside get.

257
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:37,450
So I'm going to copy this in a copy and you need to do the same thing and you need to paste it get remote

258
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,420
at origin.

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,530
And this one it's going to link whatever repository getting waves with this project.

260
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:44,990
All right.

261
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,390
So I'm going to press enter.

262
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,800
And that is that.

263
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:55,240
Now I'm going to say get push and this is the way we can have a push to files or push our repository

264
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,110
which is the master to get have by doing the get remote and or Genk we are just linking our repository

265
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,880
would get have.

266
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,640
So get push pushes all the files to the cloud.

267
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,130
So I'm going to press enter.

268
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,820
It's going to take a little while.

269
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,270
So we will fast just files and we are not including the node modules.

270
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,720
So it's going to be really fast.

271
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,820
And that is it.

272
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:26,040
Now if I go to get get have and reload the application we get our you know our project all the files

273
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,370
inside.

274
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Inside our project without of course all the Noach modules because you know we don't need them and that

275
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,150
is it.

276
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,990
So now you have you get your get get help now on the next couple of suctions you're going to be adding

277
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,760
S-sh keys right can meet need them.

278
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:49,400
And then we're going to go to Heroku link again the S-sh keys and then deploy everything to production.

279
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,640
So let's go to the next one and start with the S-sh keys.

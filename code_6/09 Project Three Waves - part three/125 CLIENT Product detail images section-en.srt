1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,800
All right.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,880
So let's do the images this and then of course we'll attach the light box.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,270
We need to do a few things.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,930
OK.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,830
So we're going to use this dependency and it was we asked images.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,450
So if I go to Google and do re-act images I'm going to open it from get have and of course we get everything

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:18,820
else.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,760
So this is a tiny example.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,400
What we do of course we put a box and inside of the images we have the property images and we need to

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
pass an array with objects and with the Source property.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,570
So right now our structure actually benefits that so we can use that but it's not really safe because

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,060
the light box is going to be creating it's going to be an outside component is going to be a reusable

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,510
component inside tills because we might use it later.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,260
Right.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,680
But that's why this is our reference.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
Let's go back to our project and I'm going to close the package that Jason and I are going about going

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,050
to go back to the index.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,710
Now what we need to do we need to create a component that is going to be rendering images.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,880
So I'm going to go to product are going to create a new file called Perrott Perrott EMG.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,480
Yes of course we need to including at the top.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:25,030
So import them to import Prod. EMG from that forward slash and then prod MGE.

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,960
Right.

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,660
Of course we need to go to the problem G and create whatever it is that we need to create.

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,180
So this brought in is going can be a Cosbys component because we need to use the state so re-act class

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,470
based component.

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,370
And we're going to call it Prod. EMG Burguet.

27
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,590
For now we are not going to do anything.

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,040
Let's go back to the parent component.

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,420
We need to include this right here inside of images.

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,540
And like I told before don't take this as a reference but I'm going to do.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,790
I'm going to do a div I'm going to add a style.

32
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:05,450
Again it's this is not responsive so I'm going to say with an attached just a fixed width with 500 pixels.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,990
Now I'm going to make a reference to this proud detail.

34
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,500
And of course since we are getting images right here inside the detail they're going to be passing the

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:22,180
detail of the of the of the actual product so detail equals and right here at the top.

36
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,340
We are not using this.

37
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,430
So it's this props that products that Perrott detail.

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,900
All right very good.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,950
So of course now we need to go to detail and catch all these for make sure this information is going

40
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,870
to go back to a proud image.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,550
Sorry.

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,640
So instead of Prod. image I'm going to go here and create some state.

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:54,470
So state open and close and right from the start begin to get to light box like box and I'm going to

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,330
set it from the default to false.

45
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,430
Now remember that whenever we want to include the box in open the light box we need to pass that is

46
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,040
open.

47
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,200
So this is going to be a true or false you know value.

48
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,790
So right from the start it's going to be false then we need to set the image position.

49
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,680
So again to say image and that pass.

50
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,790
So whenever we click on on an image right here this could be the first image the second the third one

51
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,500
or the fourth.

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,710
So whenever I click on the third the Lightbox will open on the third right or maybe the fourth.

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,310
We are clicking the fourth.

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,840
So this is where we're going to be handling this by default we open at zero which is the first image

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,230
on the on the on the list and then I'm going to create a different which is going to be light box and

56
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:47,790
that images I get told before this light box needs this structure in order to work.

57
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,300
We can get it but we need to process this a little bit more.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,210
So I'm going to go right here.

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,740
The bottom I'm going to catch this.

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,090
You know this proud detail that we're getting inside props this detail.

61
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,940
So I'm going to do a component will mount so a component will mount up sort of component that mount

62
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,600
you shouldn't use component will mount will be excluded on the next portion of react.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,510
So what do we want to do now on this case.

64
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:26,280
We are going to get some images with the properties of right here with the you know an array of objects

65
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,710
with the public I.D. and the you are l.

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,620
So the only thing that we need is the u r l but we are going to include the light box as an outside

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,690
component as a reusable components.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,840
So we always need to send one property right since what we care is the you are l right here passing

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,260
just an RE with D or else no source no nothing just an array with you or else.

70
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,810
All right.

71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,750
So I'm going to go here.

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:04,530
I'm going to do if I open and close and if we do have images if this prompts that detail detail that

73
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:11,640
images and if we have more we have more than one then we want to do this because if we have only one

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,100
M.F. image there is no need to attach it in any dye box or do any logic right here.

75
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,970
So if we get a length of greater than zero then we want to you know convert the array and everything

76
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,990
else.

77
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:33,200
So so if you have more than one image then we want to create a light box like light box.

78
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,110
Let me do it right.

79
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,110
Light box images.

80
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,310
This one is going to be an empty array and we're going to be pushing the Your else right there.

81
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:48,440
So this that props that detail that images you can create an alias so you don't have to do this that

82
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,460
props that detail that's completely up to you and I'm going to do it for each.

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,970
So for each.

84
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,660
So on that for each.

85
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,940
We will catch the item on each iteration and we will.

86
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,600
We will do.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,880
We're going to get that source that you well and we're going to push it to light box images.

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,910
So I'm going to go say like books images that push open and close.

89
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,380
Now the key for this is you are out.

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
This is the key.

91
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,260
OK.

92
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,700
And enter item and say I want to push that.

93
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,230
You are l into our New You are right.

94
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:30,300
So once we are done I'm going to do this not set state open and close and I'm going to pass the Lightbox

95
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,860
images right here.

96
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,330
So we are using the same name so I can do this.

97
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,620
All right.

98
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:47,010
So of course I'm going to do a console log this state and I'm going to go back to our project and if

99
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:55,740
I inspected we're going to get just the array of objects that I'm sorry the array of you know your else.

100
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,380
OK.

101
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,600
All right let's get one now we can begin to use this later of course this lightbox images.

102
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,760
Now.

103
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,290
First I would like to start doing the all the the layout right here so we can get at least something.

104
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,110
So on the previous section on the info right here we did this what you can do.

105
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,210
You can do something else.

106
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,290
You know very similar.

107
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:24,330
You can create a concert you can bring the detail from there and then you can say this when it comes

108
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,120
from props.

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,950
So now you have a viable that calls detail that contains the props that detail right a different way

110
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,900
to do it.

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:42,200
So I'm going to create a class name with a container of product underscore image underscore container.

112
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,560
All right.

113
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:51,350
Now at the top you can get the main pick and this one it's always the first image on that right.

114
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,920
Right.

115
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,600
OK.

116
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,430
So we're going to create a container div class name main pick.

117
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,840
And inside we will just put a div with a background image.

118
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,350
Right.

119
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,540
OK.

120
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,350
Now the first pic is the one that needs to come up you know comes as props now might happen that we

121
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,920
don't have an image with that image.

122
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,240
It's like the the other ones the sorry image not available because we don't get it.

123
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,820
So we need to check if we do have a real image to play.

124
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,500
Because if not we are not going we are going to be displaying nothing.

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,750
All right.

126
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,540
Just like it happens right now.

127
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,510
OK.

128
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,170
So I'm going to say style equals to open and close and I'm going to say background.

129
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,980
Now the background.

130
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:47,250
It will be equal to your L and I will be passing the Ural and then I'm going to say no real Pete.

131
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,790
Now I'm going to hand I'm going to create a function to handle the you know show the correct image or

132
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,520
show the other one the you know not found.

133
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:07,470
So I'm going to call this this render render and then card and then image and as it's of no value I'm

134
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,460
going to be passing whatever we get in detail which is this one.

135
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,530
And that images are going to pass the array of images we get from the parent you know from this one

136
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,410
from the detail not the one we are doing inside like books images.

137
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,150
OK.

138
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:28,580
So we don't have this function going to go and created right now equals to open and close.

139
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,840
And of course we will need to return a value right.

140
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,590
So what we need to do is to check if we do have an image.

141
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,220
If we we have something inside of that right now going to create an if then else.

142
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:51,120
So if has to be images dot because we are passing the images arguments right here so images dot and

143
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,110
then we check the length and if it's greater than zero it means that you know we have something.

144
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,430
So what I'm going to do I'm going to do.

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,240
Return

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,980
images the precision number zero and do your L because this is a background of poverty.

147
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,060
We just need your help.

148
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,190
Nothing else.

149
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:19,340
Now of course if we don't have the image I'm going to return open it close and images forward slash.

150
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,690
And remember that we have that image not available.

151
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:28,020
So Image not on those core available that P and G.

152
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,460
Just like with before with the carts it's pretty much the same thing.

153
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,740
Let me just it again of course we are getting the first images image because whenever we bring the data

154
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,270
out of this we do have images.

155
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,490
So this is the first one.

156
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,790
If I go to a different one that it's not available we get nothing.

157
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,400
Let me show why and should check why maybe the the route is incorrect but we know we are attaching these

158
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,130
images image not available PNB.

159
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,090
I know it's the same stick with it before I did before.

160
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,940
So I'm going to copy the name because the name is incorrect and I'm not changing the names because I've

161
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,450
already give you all the files everything else.

162
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,840
So again I cannot go backwards.

163
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,120
Sometimes when I make mistakes I need to fix it with you right here.

164
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,480
So Image not available.

165
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,200
All right.

166
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,180
Now we should be getting something at least and we get it we get it.

167
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,920
Let's get.

168
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,400
All right.

169
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,770
We're going to go back.

170
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,760
Going to go to New Product.

171
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,470
Just going to reload just in case it's OK.

172
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,710
So now for example later when we click here when you click on that image I want to open the light box.

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
So I need to fire that light box.

174
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,180
You can be using in a couple of minutes.

175
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,840
So I'm going to attach this on click function.

176
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,260
So I'm going to go here and say whenever we do anon click and let me fix the one at the top.

177
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,440
There we go.

178
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,900
Whenever we do an unclick

179
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I'm going to do something.

180
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,710
And what am I going to do.

181
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm going to do this.

182
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,850
Dad handle and then lightbox.

183
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,560
So this function is the one there's that handle.

184
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,800
There we go.

185
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,520
This function is the one that it's going to be deciding what do we need to open.

186
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:27,630
If you want to open at zero position or maybe the second position or third position and everything else.

187
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,250
So of course this function is not ready yet.

188
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,460
We're going to create it in a minute.

189
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,790
All right.

190
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,650
Now again we need to pass that position you're going to see of course we're going to discuss right here

191
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,030
pretty much the same thing and you're going to get it of course at the bottom.

192
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,320
We have more images.

193
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,510
We can have two three more five or 10 whatever is that you attached to that you know place the product.

194
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,320
So for this one we will create a new container called class name.

195
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,270
Main thumbs.

196
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,660
All right.

197
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
So this one again is going to be a function.

198
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,380
But now we need to render all the remaining images we can not just skip this one and show the other

199
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,260
images.

200
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,680
So again we can process this in a function.

201
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,510
So this does it show.

202
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,730
And then thumbs and we are going to be passing whatever we get back from the detail.

203
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,840
Let me make it ride thumps.

204
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,100
OK.

205
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,570
So let's create the function and return some GSX going to do it right here.

206
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,550
He calls to open and close and that's it.

207
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:38,930
OK.

208
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,050
Now we need to create a function.

209
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,030
Let me check the time.

210
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,620
We are OK.

211
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,890
So OK on shoat thumbs.

212
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,290
Pretty simple stuff.

213
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,640
We need to of course loop the information.

214
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,450
We get all the detailed images.

215
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,880
But if you remember we already have something inside the component will mount.

216
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,900
We have the Lightbox images.

217
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:06,770
So what we can do we can check the light but like box images check if we have a more than one right.

218
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:13,500
And if we have more than one we want to of course show the remaining all the pictures but the first

219
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,620
image is simple.

220
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:26,550
So I'm going to go to show thumbs I'm going to say this dot state DOT light box images dot map and I

221
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,750
get to do item.

222
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,740
And of course we will return some GSX.

223
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,340
So let me fix this.

224
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,170
Very good.

225
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,930
So what I'm going to be passing is a new item and iteration.

226
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,460
And then of course we will return more GSX.

227
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:47,810
So now again we need to return only if we if we are on the second position of the array.

228
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,140
Right on the on the second value which is the first the number 1.

229
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,990
So if the iteration is greater than zero then we want to return it.

230
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,350
If not we are not going to return anything.

231
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,650
So what we do we return a div just a div with some property inside.

232
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,280
So if the property is going to go right here it's going to be the key.

233
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,730
Of course we always need to pass the key.

234
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,760
Now we need to do the unclick just like with it right here.

235
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:23,370
I'm going to copy this just like this and say that whenever we do an and click on click I get a copy

236
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,520
of this because it's pretty much the same thing.

237
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,400
So whenever we do one and click on this I went to trigger this function that opens the box at a certain

238
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,130
decision.

239
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,700
Now I'm passing the zero and this is why we are bringing the index since we have the index on the array.

240
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,670
We have the order.

241
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,390
So I'm passing the dynamic value.

242
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,720
Now I'm going to attach a class name the class name for this one.

243
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,710
It's going to be thumb thumb.

244
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,810
And again to add some more style and the style it's the background image so background and right here

245
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,840
we don't need to do this logic with it did right here at the top you know showing the image the first

246
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,960
image or doing this because if we do have more elements on the array it's because we do have images.

247
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:17,460
So we're going to do your L opening close and pass the item because we are just looping an array of

248
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,990
images and then no repeat.

249
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,660
Right.

250
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,350
And that's it.

251
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,650
See what we get.

252
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,580
Maybe stick something.

253
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,850
Let me just double check.

254
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,860
I mean forget forgetting to do something.

255
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,790
Second are just the.

256
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,450
What is wrong because we should be getting something at least.

257
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,140
Let me just do the inspect the console.

258
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,490
We get nothing on the console.

259
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:59,810
And if I go right here the bottom left and then product image container and ride and then and the thumbs

260
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,540
we get we are actually getting the images we are.

261
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,560
But some of these we are I believe the classes.

262
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,650
Maybe it's wrong.

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,760
Let me just double check on the classes and yes Or for that it was a class error.

264
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:23,580
So maintenance because we were getting it on the HD male and we get images of course later we can click

265
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:30,030
it and begin to trigger that function that opens the box at the particular this particular position.

266
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,920
All right.

267
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,130
And again don't take this as a reference I'm just attaching an image and doing it because contain.

268
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,650
Right.

269
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,430
And just setting it at the middle or at the bottom and realize you need to do a little bit better with

270
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
the CSSA force.

271
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:51,720
So we pretty much have all we need to start with the Lightbox we have all the images and the listeners

272
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,570
with the unclick.

273
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,260
So we need to bring the light box and start passing Baillieu's to the light box.

274
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,220
So let's go to the next one and do the box.

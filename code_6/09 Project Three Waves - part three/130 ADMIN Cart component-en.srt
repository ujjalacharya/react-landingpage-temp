1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,630
OK science now we can add products to the user cart.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:11,680
Now we of course will create the end point where we can see the cart remove items get the total amount.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,280
And of course to check out if you want to buy this.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,020
OK.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,630
So first we need to do a lot of things we didn't have a component for this and we need to add it to

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,920
the routes as well.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,500
So going to go to the user component and creating a new file called cart.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,680
Yes.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,300
All right.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,250
So of course this one will be a react Cosbys component just like this and I'm going to call it user

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,150
cart.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:45,460
OK then I'm going to bring the user layout so import import user lay out from that force last one more

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,390
time and then chose C for Slash and the user.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,700
All right.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,090
Now I'm going to bring connect.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:01:00,770
We're going to use later so import connect from re-act redux react and then redux.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,660
Right.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,060
And we're going to use fonts.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,540
Awesome.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,610
So I'm going to import some brain now so we can get an out of the way and then later of course we're

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
going to use it and we don't need to do the boring you know import.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,540
Awesome awesome.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,450
And then icon and it's going to be from and it's at the fort.

24
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,290
Awesome react for it.

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,840
Awesome right.

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:32,950
So the two icons we need to use is the FAA import FAA and then frown just like this from ad and it's

27
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,030
forward awesome again.

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,620
But this one it's the free solid and we need to pass.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,470
Of course the name of the icon right here.

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,010
And the other one will be the opposite of this which is F A and then smile.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,520
All right.

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm going to grab the connect.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to do the connect and then wrap the components and right here I'm going to go and say cart.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,690
So OK.

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,210
We can use this right now.

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,580
And of course we are going to get something at least before I can do that.

37
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,580
I cannot wrap everything inside of the user or lay out so we can get the beautiful land.

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,520
And then of course we need to create the route we need to tell the router that we want to use this.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,000
So I'm going to go here and say import user cart and notice that I'm doing this on the opening section.

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:32,980
So I'm going to call it again use cart real simple and it's from from DOD force components for Slash.

41
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:40,960
Then user for Slash and then cart right in it copy the user dashboard because pretty much the same configuration

42
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,590
and it's going to be inside user and then cart and we will use the component just like this we're going

43
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,630
to log out right here and get to log in.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,230
All right.

45
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,610
So franaise.

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,080
And then password one two three.

47
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:56,830
OK.

48
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,660
So if I go to use our card we get a card that is good.

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,960
So what do we need to do first before we can do anything.

50
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,390
We need to fetch the list of items we have in the cart and we need more information than the one we

51
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,710
have and the redux store whenever we go to the user state.

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,180
So if I go to user user data we go to the cart and we get three items.

53
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,350
But this is just the idea of the product the quantity and the date.

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,490
So of course we need a lot more than this right.

55
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,720
So what we will do will creating you create a new route on the server of course.

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,850
And right here we're going to go to redux go to that server and past the list of the ID you know this

57
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,050
ID is that right.

58
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,210
And of course the server will get the ID and return the the all the up you know the detailed information

59
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,070
about this product.

60
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,210
Of course we didn't have this route.

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,190
We're going to create in a couple of minutes.

62
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,140
So first of course I'm going to do some things right here.

63
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm going to add first to state.

64
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,970
We're going to use the state and this one is going to be equal to loading.

65
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,970
So we're going to have this loading then a coma at the end.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,190
Of course we need to calculate the total So the total always starts at zero.

67
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:16,320
Now if the transaction goes success I'm going to do a show and then success just like that of course

68
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
at the beginning it's going to be false.

69
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,250
Now of course if we don't have any items or will you know after we created a section I need to lead

70
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,190
the application know that we want to show the total.

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,340
So at the beginning is going to start.

72
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,910
It's false.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,180
And after we get all the information from the server and you know to everything else you can of course

74
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,270
change it to true.

75
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,270
If we do have items on the card because could happen that we don't.

76
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,310
OK.

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,100
So what we need to do we need to dispatch an action right.

78
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:44,790
All right.

79
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,840
We don't have this.

80
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,330
We're going to create in a couple of minutes.

81
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,720
So when we do it we're going to do it on the component at Mt..

82
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,330
Right.

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,040
Okay.

84
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,780
Now I'm going to create two different virals and I can explain why in a second I'm going to create a

85
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,390
cart.

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,030
Let part item equals That's right.

87
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,630
OK.

88
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,330
So they're going to say lead user they're going to just make reference to create an alias for this.

89
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,150
I mean to say that this that prompts the user.

90
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,820
So basically I'm just entering prompts and getting everything that it's inside of the user including

91
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,690
the user data.

92
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,340
And of course all the card that it's inside the user data now to access prompts.

93
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,310
Of course we need to do the map state to prop's So we're going to go and do map state to prop's map

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,750
state to prop's going to dilute the own props.

95
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,000
And what we what we'll be going to using is the user Ryan.

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,500
So user user it just maps state prompts nothing new so far.

97
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,140
So let me tell you what the problem is of me.

98
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,920
Go right here to our application and of course if I check the state I have a card.

99
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,410
Ryan and his ID card.

100
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,740
We have three elements.

101
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,710
So the only only information that we get inside of here is just the idea of the product and the quantity.

102
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,330
Right.

103
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,000
OK.

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,800
Now where do we go to the server.

105
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,310
The server will return this ID.

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,740
Right.

107
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,960
It's going to return pretty much the same array.

108
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,350
But with all the detailed information.

109
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,810
Right.

110
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,520
OK.

111
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:19,080
Now the problem is that we to get it from the server from the model of products and we didn't have the

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,170
quantity right there.

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,900
So we need to make a mix between both.

114
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,960
We're going to can begin to get.

115
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,200
Of course this card from the user.

116
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,640
And we're going to bring the one from the server that belongs to this ID.

117
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,890
And inside of that result we're going to inject the quantity that we get for that for that product.

118
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,310
All right.

119
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,390
So let's go to the component about let's start this.

120
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,560
Now first we need to do something if we do have information inside the user card data.

121
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:57,380
So first I'm going to say if user because we made a name I where I hear that and then user data you're

122
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,190
entering prompts.

123
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,710
And then the user data.

124
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,840
Right.

125
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,490
These are data dots and begin to use carped begin entering the card.

126
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,430
If we do have information inside the card if we do have a card then of course we're going to move forward

127
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,980
because we do have a card.

128
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,810
Now the problem again is that the card might be empty.

129
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,360
So I'm going to do one more check.

130
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:28,730
I'm going to say if user that cart data Dot card again that and then length you know very simple solution

131
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,610
length it's there go it's greater than zero.

132
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,130
Then of course we assume that we know actually that we get some we have some information inside the

133
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,600
cart.

134
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,700
So we want to go to the server and get it right.

135
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,590
OK.

136
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,870
Now again we can not pass this to the to the server.

137
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,350
We could you know and do all the logic on the server.

138
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,930
But on the server we just need to pass the ID remember that we can get around to just like this that

139
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,580
where we can pass many IDs and we're going to get the information about this.

140
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,660
Well this is pretty much the same idea.

141
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,110
We cannot pass this of objects to the server because we just need the I.D. We don't need the quantity

142
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,490
or nor the date.

143
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,580
So we're going to go here and say OK I want to enter the user again user data.

144
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:27,260
We could create an alias for user data and card you know so card data and then going to do a For Each

145
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,920
cell for each.

146
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,510
Let me do it right for each.

147
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,520
OK.

148
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,810
So open it close.

149
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,270
Now we're going to get one item and then we're going to do something.

150
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,290
So we're not going to do.

151
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:43,610
We're going to make reference to this card item and they're going to do push open it close and it get

152
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,060
it past the item that I.D..

153
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:53,120
So at the end we just get a single barbel with an array which has IDs you know we have three products

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,280
you can have the idea of this product and the of course coma.

155
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,740
The idea of the second one and so on.

156
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,850
So we can check send this to the server and the server will know that oh ok I need to fetch all the

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,660
products.

158
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,260
So this is pretty much what we are doing right now.

159
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,960
We could handle this directly on the server.

160
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:19,130
But again I prefer to do it right here on the client Ogam of course then when you did this pageant action

161
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,350
we don't have an action let's create it right now.

162
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,710
So let's go to user actions here.

163
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,350
User actions and of course when two types.

164
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:35,590
So instead of user actions I'm going to create a new one we could call it whatever we want to call it

165
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,210
a get carte items.

166
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:46,250
So export function get cart items now on this one we will be getting two different arguments right.

167
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,400
So cart items which is the array of items.

168
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,690
And then I get to pass a second thing which is user and then cart.

169
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,950
Let me go use our cart of course at the end you're going to return a type and a payload.

170
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:08,920
So gonna return the type which is going to be let's call it get carte items.

171
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,910
User.

172
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,640
OK.

173
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,860
So of course then a payload.

174
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,340
And for now the payload is going to be empty payload empty.

175
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,400
And of course we need to do more work right here at the right time at the top going to save it to go

176
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,090
to types and export Konst.

177
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:36,200
And then of course we do it again get it dry get carte item and the user.

178
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,130
You could call it whatever you want doesn't matter.

179
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,610
So now you get the user action and we need to add it to the reducers.

180
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:51,810
So I still are going to bring the time at the top so coma type and then are going to go right here at

181
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,300
the bottom.

182
00:10:52,330 --> 00:11:01,690
So case we get the get item card use or whatever I want to return open and close that state and that's

183
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,370
it for now.

184
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,530
Of course we're going to test Rob first.

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,360
It's OK.

186
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,120
We have the actual function which so we can dispatch it right.

187
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,490
OK.

188
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:16,510
Get the card items going to go to court and I'm going to import it at the top so import just like this.

189
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,760
And of course let me just double check.

190
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:27,940
Yeah we need to go right here and save from and we need to directory's up to the DOT DOT DOT for Slash

191
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,930
and then actions for Slash and it's user actions.

192
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,750
OK.

193
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,410
So everything looks nice.

194
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,900
Of course.

195
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,650
Now we need to dispatch it.

196
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,180
So let's let's created this patch.

197
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,810
Of course after we're done we're going to say this that prompts that dispatch.

198
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,210
All right.

199
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,860
Open and close now get carte items and I'm going to be passing this card item we get right here and

200
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,000
then I'm going to be passing coma.

201
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:04,030
And it has the user that user data dot cart Oh sorry cart.

202
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,050
So I think it's again the card of the user.

203
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,100
So if you go here I'm passing this information.

204
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,140
The one that contains the the ID the quantity and the date.

205
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,380
You can see why in a second.

206
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,360
And of course then we can catch to then of course we just run a function was simple and begin to of

207
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,060
course do something.

208
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,380
All right.

209
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,420
So what is going to happen of course begin to make the request and begin to inspect it from here because

210
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,820
it's going to be a little bit weird.

211
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,380
There's kind of a funny scenario.

212
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,260
So we're going to go do we have a route to do this.

213
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:50,640
Well if we go to the server just here if you go to the server and start you know we try to find a route

214
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,280
where we can make this we do have it right.

215
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:03,580
We have the articles by id remember the articles by ID might be getting an ID quite type 1 ID and many

216
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,010
ID at the same time.

217
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,420
And right here we have that we have just that you know just an array with items so we can use this.

218
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,410
Articles by id route.

219
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,020
OK.

220
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,620
I going to go back to user actions and remember that these articles by ID is a product route and at

221
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:27,030
the top we are not importing the user that the products server we are using the user server.

222
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:35,280
So I'm going to go copy the product server going to go back to user actions and import it at the top.

223
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,510
So now we can use it.

224
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,200
OK.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm going to go back and bomb.

226
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:49,000
And I'm going to say Konst re quest equals then we get X-post that get opening close and remember that

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,760
we are we're using quite strings.

228
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:59,890
We're going to use quite strings so we make reference to that products and that server or at done so

229
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,440
if you remember the route its products Oh it's articles right.

230
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,550
Forgot the name of the route.

231
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,450
Articles by ID.

232
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,900
So then I had to pause for a second.

233
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,160
Are Building.

234
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,260
They're making a new building just you know.

235
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,180
And they're driving me crazy.

236
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,840
So I had to stop it for a minute.

237
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:28,120
So of course we need to pass strings and we need to pass the ID equals the card items.

238
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,720
Right.

239
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,430
And if you remember we need to give the type of this says we're passing an array.

240
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,030
We need to say array.

241
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,120
OK.

242
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,690
Of course then we will get a new response.

243
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,230
I'm going to do this at the bottom.

244
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,940
Then of course we get you response and then that response begin to getcha.

245
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,880
Catch the data and we're going to have a lot of problems a few problems with this first going to the

246
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,960
console log and then check what we get from response that data.

247
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,450
And I at return the response that data this is going to change a little bit in a minute.

248
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,160
And of course right now I'm going to send back whatever we get from the request and I'm going to go

249
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,520
to the user and do the user right here.

250
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,470
Now I'm just going to do the project so we can of course get it later.

251
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,220
So we going to return the state and a cart detail so all of the information about the cart is going

252
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,380
to be inside this key card detail we're going to of course see it working later.

253
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,090
So OK so we can skip the error message if we don't return anything from the promise.

254
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,300
So at the end we get this you know and we are actually getting something from the server.

255
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,420
So we get all the information about the product right.

256
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,870
The first one it's the first item which we have three.

257
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,630
We have three we purchased three of this item.

258
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,130
So the title the rocket whatever whatever whatever that is good.

259
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,050
So we get all the information now.

260
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,490
The problem is that it's out of here we didn't have the quantity.

261
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,580
How many items we purchase of this one are we added to the card of this one actually we added to the

262
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,640
carby getting to the purchased just yet.

263
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,780
So what we need to do we need to inject how many items of this ID we have inside the user.

264
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,820
And then the card detail remember that we got that information and the card detail.

265
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,670
Let's go to the right here now.

266
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,250
Now this one I'm sorry the is the user data and the cart right here we have three.

267
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,620
So we're going to loop this.

268
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,050
The response we get back from the server begin to match the IDs and if there is a match We're going

269
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,990
to insert a new key telling us the quantity.

270
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,570
So in the future we can of course just use this to get the all the data of the product and how many

271
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,210
items they are you know purchasing.

272
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,880
All right let's.

273
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,290
Of course one way to do it.

274
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
So back to the user action.

275
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,510
I'm going to delete this action.

276
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,530
I'm going to delete this because we are not going to need it.

277
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,580
So we're going to get a response with three items right now.

278
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,470
And of course we get the user Karch which is the detail information that says the ID and the quantity.

279
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,260
So we going to make a mix out of both marvels.

280
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:10,240
So use are going to enter use cart and are going to do for each each and this one of course we will

281
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,150
pass the item and then we will run a function where we do something.

282
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,180
Now this one is going to be the parent ride.

283
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,310
So for each child inside of the response are going to love the child.

284
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,210
And I'm going to try to match the idea of the parent if there is a match.

285
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,990
We're going to add the quantity to the child of the parent.

286
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,920
So responds that data that for each.

287
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,700
Right.

288
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,640
So opening close and I'm going to say right here.

289
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,290
OK.

290
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,370
And I you could call this whatever you want.

291
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,430
Now of course we're going to answer the first one which is the first element of the parent.

292
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,920
And then we're going to enter and loop all the responses all the array we get in response to data.

293
00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:05,290
So if the let me do an if if the item which is the item parent that ID matches one of the child IDs

294
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:13,720
we get then we get to enter the child inside responds that data are going to enter with the iteration

295
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,620
and are going to say OK I want to add one that says quantity just like this and the value of this is

296
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,000
going to be equal to whatever we had we get on the parent for the same ID.

297
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,990
So item that quantity.

298
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,460
And at the end we'll have pretty much the same response data but with the real quantity inside.

299
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:41,170
OK I'm going to go back and say return response that data.

300
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,300
All right so.

301
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,750
OK.

302
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,480
So now we're going to be getting the information to see want together get right.

303
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,670
Let's inspect.

304
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,190
So it reloads and of course we go to state.

305
00:18:53,270 --> 00:19:01,000
Now go to user and I get to go to car detail and right here at the bottom we get the quantities for

306
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,560
this when we get to ride.

307
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,260
We didn't have that.

308
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,000
Now we get it now and the other ones we just have one.

309
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,060
So you want to do one and the other one.

310
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,870
It's one but we have three.

311
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,160
OK.

312
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,950
A lot.

313
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,070
So of course now we're going to loop all of this information we can create a new component that renders

314
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,260
all the blocks right here and we're going to be passing this information right.

315
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,230
And they will show the title the image the quantity and everything else.

316
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,360
And then we will create a function that can loop.

317
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,090
This is going to grab the prize.

318
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,530
And of course multiply the prize because we needed to calculate the total.

319
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,290
Now the only thing that we're not going to do.

320
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,890
And of course if you want to do it no problem that's you know it's going to be fun.

321
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,440
It's of course to reduce the quantity maybe have a button to add more or reduce more.

322
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,250
And for this of course you will need a special route or special logic because you need to grab the idea

323
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,250
of whatever the user or they are they are trying to do.

324
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,670
Go to the server modify the quantity from the server and when it comes back you need to re fetch or

325
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,310
recalculate all of this through the store run.

326
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,200
All right.

327
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,640
So let's go to the next section.

328
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,870
We're going to grab the list of products and create the blocks right here.

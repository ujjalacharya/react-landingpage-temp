1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,150
Write so let's keep going with this.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,420
We need to add this.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,210
I'm going to call it product tax.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,000
This one tax you know attack then actions so get the you know this and maybe later we could get more

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,740
actions maybe contact us or something like that.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,200
For now it's going to be very simple.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,060
And then we get the specifications.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,620
So I'm going to go here at the bottom and I add just the function which is going to be show show then

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,800
prod and then tax.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,760
All right.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,090
And we're going to be passing whatever we get back from detail Ryan Ryan so detail this detail which

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,370
is equal to prod and then detail.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,670
All right.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,080
So I'm going to go at the top and create this show Prod. stack just like this.

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,730
We're going to get something and then we do something and we're going to be returning of course some

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,540
sex.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,740
So we need to open and close that we will be seeing the details.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,550
I'm going to say detail now I'm going to wrap everything inside of a container class name of product

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,680
product underscore tax and right here some of the simple some of the articles.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,000
They have shipping.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,510
So if we do have shipping we can show this.

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,920
If we don't have any shipping we are not going added Of course because it's not free shipping.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,920
So maybe you are buying something.

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,040
I don't know that worth maybe $10 or $20 so there's no shipping for that of course.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,760
So shipping detailed shipping if we do have something we get going return.

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,910
If not the original nil.

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,390
So here I'm going to add DIVX and I'm going to add the tags and they are all pretty much the same.

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,280
That's why I'm telling you this one is going to be easy.

29
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,280
There's a lot of copy pasting.

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,770
So the name of the attack of course the class name call stack.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,230
And the first thing we will get the font awesome icon so font awesome icon opening close.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,630
Now the icon of this one is going to be the truck.

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,740
Remember the shipping.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,420
So F-8 truck right.

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,350
Then we have the text.

36
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:14,990
So Dave and I are going to add the class name of tack text and this one should be saying Free Shipping

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,810
Free Shipping.

38
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,470
And since we have it on two lines I did something simple.

39
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:28,800
So free shipping and of course I'm going to add a second line like it's holding something very simple

40
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,100
and then and return.

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,390
All right.

42
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,650
So let's check it out.

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
Show PRUD stock.

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,400
It's not that fun.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,030
I made a mistake with this.

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,970
It should be canceled because this is the functional component.

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,350
It's not a class.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,180
And right here I'm making it a track us string.

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,470
So it should be available.

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,150
All right.

51
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,150
OK.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,470
What is next.

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,190
We have the availability.

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,310
You know if it's available or not and there's two ways you can do this are going to do one way and then

55
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,570
I'm going to tell you a different way you can do this.

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,550
Of course we can attach a different conditionals if we have detail available.

57
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,750
We can do something now if not we can show something else right.

58
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,950
We can know this.

59
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,130
So for this one I want to pretty much show the same tax on going to copy and paste and make it a little

60
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,160
bit better.

61
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,090
So if it's available I want to show the fake check.

62
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,980
Right because we get a checkmark right.

63
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,690
And instead of here is going to say available

64
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,370
in store we get rid of this and store.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,240
Of course if it's not available I'm pretty much showing the same things.

66
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,930
I'm going to copy paste and change the icons and everything else.

67
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,130
And now I'm going to tell you maybe a different way to do this.

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:02,770
So this one should be five times just like this and it's going to be not available not available preorder

69
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,670
free or other only.

70
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,980
So of course we're going to reload the application and we get the available in-store because this element

71
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,140
is available right now.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,250
Instead of doing this because again we are doing a lot of more code.

73
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,640
What you can do is just put a conditional of detail available instead of the icon to show the check

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,930
or show the Times and the same thing with the context.

75
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,490
Right.

76
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,750
If you have if you get the the available true you showed this.

77
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,980
If not you show the other one you just put the same conditional on different spots.

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,260
So you can get rid of the you know redoing the tags and everything else.

79
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:43,770
All right.

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,130
That's one way to do it.

81
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,930
OK.

82
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,870
So let's keep going.

83
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,990
We get the actions.

84
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,610
It's the number and the actual button.

85
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,010
So I'm going to go at the bottom and create a new function.

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:04,470
So this one is going to be called show prod and then actions open and close and we pass the detail right.

87
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,910
So on the create function.

88
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,610
So it's going to be Konst show productions and then we are going to do something.

89
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,570
So this action is just renders the cart ride the cart button and the price.

90
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,510
Now we didn't have the special bond and because it isn't special.

91
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,730
We're going to talk about that in a second so detailed we pass this.

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:37,460
And then of course we'll return a dev with a class name of product and then actions.

93
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:44,340
Now on this one we will show the price and that's why it's simple enough so we get a class name off

94
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
price just like this.

95
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,150
And then of course we attached a price.

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,450
Right.

97
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,220
Makes sense.

98
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,360
So detail dot price.

99
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,470
Let's see if we get that at least so we get the price.

100
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:01,740
All right.

101
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,740
So let's go to the bun create a death and this one it's going to be the cart so we're going to have

102
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,990
a lot of fun with this.

103
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,410
So we need to add.

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,160
Now if we think about this the button looks a little bit different than the other ones.

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,690
That's one thing and the thing is that this is not a link.

106
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,900
This is a burn net whenever we click it.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,200
We need to fire a function that adds to the cart.

108
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,980
And whenever we add to the cart of course we need to go to the My Account added to the users to the

109
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,770
user account on the server.

110
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,300
Right.

111
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,200
So we need to do a lot of things but for this when of course we need to trigger a function.

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,680
So first I'm going to import my button right here at the top.

113
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,390
And we didn't we don't have this button.

114
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,180
We need to create the bun.

115
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,020
All right.

116
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,710
So I'm going to type I'm going to close it just like this and I'm going to pass the time.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,700
Remember that with the type we got things so as to card like.

118
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,110
All right.

119
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,380
We will need to create a type a button with this type.

120
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,070
Right.

121
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,600
So then I'm going to attach a different prop which is going to be run action.

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,830
What's going to happen whenever we click this.

123
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,500
So what is going to happen is that we run in a different function.

124
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,860
Right.

125
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,090
Just a different function.

126
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,790
And this one is going to be something being added later.

127
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,680
All right.

128
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,420
For now just going to say console log

129
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,940
at to cart whatever.

130
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,920
OK.

131
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,690
So we need to go to buttons right here and we need to create the Add to Cart link.

132
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,430
Right.

133
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,700
All right.

134
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,720
Let's do that right now.

135
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,750
All right.

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,430
So let's add the case are going to do.

137
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,030
Case off.

138
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,620
And if we get at card link we do something with this.

139
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,120
And of course never forget the break.

140
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:56,220
So what we will be returning again is just the template and the template is going to be very very simple

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,020
because it's just a button with a class you know a div with a class that has an unclick on it.

142
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:07,180
And with unclick we just run the function that we are passing as a callback right.

143
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,770
So class name.

144
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,460
And then I believe we call it at Codling when we use the same thing.

145
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,140
And then of course we need to attach the on click.

146
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:26,070
So on click equals open and close and we run whatever we're getting from prop's ride and then run action.

147
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,380
This is the name of we are passing the prop you're passing run action and then we will trigger this

148
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,570
OK.

149
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,590
So instead of you're going to copy the you want awesome icon and we will use the same thing.

150
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,180
The FAA shopping bag.

151
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,940
And then add to cart.

152
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,660
All right and we get it.

153
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,100
Let me go to inspect the console and if I click it we get to cart.

154
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,320
All right let's get it works.

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,460
Later we are going to be doing this logic.

156
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,130
All right.

157
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,530
Well let's go back to private info and finish unfinished part info.

158
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,640
So then we have the specifications.

159
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:14,650
I'm going to go at the bottom and say show Pernod and then specifications and we will pass the detail

160
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,220
around.

161
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,990
All right.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,150
Copy the function just like before going to a concert.

163
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,350
The name of the function.

164
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,490
We run something.

165
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,330
And then of course we do something and we need to pass the detail right.

166
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,920
OK.

167
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,850
We will be returning some GSX.

168
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,770
So I'm going to delete this and put the parenthesis.

169
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,410
All right.

170
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:44,770
So Dave we add a class name of product underscore specifications and then we need a title.

171
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,460
Let me just show you the final one.

172
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,120
We get the title and then just the frets.

173
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,230
Right.

174
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,550
So H-2 is going to be an age to tag and then specifications.

175
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,180
And just going to call specs.

176
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,880
Right.

177
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,180
We have it better.

178
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,140
So Dave.

179
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:10,930
And now for each one we will add a day of class something class name item and right here we will have

180
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,790
a strong.

181
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:21,340
Because as you know the name of field than Fretz open and close and after the strong we do for its detail

182
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,820
and then we have the conference detail.

183
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,850
All right.

184
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:34,360
We're going to copy same thing and we have the word for now we just get two categories the wood and

185
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,070
the frets of course in real life.

186
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,810
You're going to get a lot of things right.

187
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,830
You can get a lot of this a lot of this.

188
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,310
OK.

189
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,570
So detail and remember that would we get an idea.

190
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,920
So we need to enter word because we are getting getting it from the server like this and then enter

191
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,170
the name.

192
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,450
All right let's check it out.

193
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,560
So we got 24 hours.

194
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,540
And this is older right.

195
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,700
Because this is the baby time.

196
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,890
And it's not an R.G. to 5 it's a different name just made this up.

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,510
OK.

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,210
So we get all the detail.

199
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
Everything works OK.

200
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,660
So now what we need to do we need to create the light box and for that we need to do a little bit more

201
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,240
logic and we are going to be using a dependency we've already installed this.

202
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,700
Let me see if I can find it.

203
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,990
I don't see it has to be here.

204
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,050
React images I don't remember right now but it's just that it's just a light box right.

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,850
It's just a light box really really simple.

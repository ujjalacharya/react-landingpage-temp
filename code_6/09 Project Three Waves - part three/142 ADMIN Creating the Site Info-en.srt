1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,980
All right so now we are going to do the site info.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,680
So inside of the site info it's going to be pretty much different components.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,840
For now we're going to get only one later I'm going to do as a bonus one more component but pretty much

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,660
in this place we can we can update the site information just like the footer with the address and the

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,780
phone and everything else and maybe you are thinking why doing this.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,150
Well imagine that you're the owner of the other shop needs to change the phone and you can have a common

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,300
place to do that.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,980
So they will need to contact you and you will need to go make the changes you know deploying the application

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,500
again.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,570
So you know not a good idea.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,380
OK.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,680
So first we need to come place to it so we can render this site info.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,760
So I'm going to go to user are going to go to admin because he's an admin route and I'm going to create

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,200
a new file called manage and then site that jackass.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,620
Now this managed site is going to be kind of like the index because remember I told you I'm going to

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,430
do a bonus section with a feature.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,220
So this one is just going to render a component that contains a form.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,550
So we can you know make the request to make the update.

19
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,220
Right.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,470
So Match site is going to be a re-act stateless component and I'm going to call it manage and then site

21
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,530
right to that and then manage site.

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:33,170
It's going to create insight Atman a new file called Update site and then info whenever you know something

23
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,400
like a good name.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,300
So this one is going to be react class-B component because we need to dispatch actions.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:47,160
Use forms and everything else so update a model within the company will you update then site and then

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,870
info and then side info.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,810
Or could be formed you know form that's get a copy of course from within mench side.

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:05,700
We need to import it so Update site info from that forward slash and then update site info.

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,620
And of course I'm going to make a reference to this component inside of your second open.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
Make the reference and that's it.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,480
That is the only thing that this component is going to do.

32
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,200
Now of course we need to create the route.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,900
Oh and of course we need to include the user layout.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:30,150
So import then user and then lay out from that for Slashdot for Slash that one more time then I believe

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,780
it's a chose C..

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,810
And then for Slash and.

37
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,730
Oh no sorry it's one more up three.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,690
So H.O. C and then use lay out right.

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,200
And we need to wrap pretty much the whole component inside of here.

40
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,440
Of course we need to we need to add this as a route.

41
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,210
No.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,910
So let's go to routes.

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,210
First I'm going to import it so import and we call this managed site.

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,990
From dobbed forward slash components for Slash user or slash.

45
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,030
And then the update.

46
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,520
Now been of course then for Slash and then manage site.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,260
So since this is anatman I'm going to copy and paste it at the bottom and this one.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,780
The route for this site info could be you know something else but that's OK.

49
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,240
So going to paste it and of course every year load the application.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,290
We get the nav and then the form which is the component inside this one.

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,890
All right.

52
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,020
So we need to do a lot of things first.

53
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,100
First let's start to get something out of this.

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,190
Maybe the form or a title or something.

55
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,100
You know the start to create the form up.

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,790
Going to close this one close and pretty much everything.

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,250
And just like with that before because we are going to be working with forms are going to go to the

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,180
ER just to log in and bring the register components because we need to import things at the top and

59
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,080
you know this ones are pretty much the same thing.

60
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,310
So update site info.

61
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,710
I'm going to paste it right here so we have a form fill up update generated data is form valid and if

62
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,880
you remember with that function you know to populate fields.

63
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,350
So this one is the same.

64
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,130
Same thing.

65
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,870
So I'm going to go to update personal info where we actually it.

66
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,800
I did this and copied it populate field right comma and paste it.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,310
Now the rowdiest is going to be a little bit different so that forward slash.

68
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:46,310
One more one directory up and the same thing for you tells all right going to save it and see if we

69
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,070
can get the error.

70
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,760
Now let's get it works.

71
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,050
Now we need to connect.

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:58,230
So import then connect and then from Riak redux.

73
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,450
All right.

74
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,060
And of course then later we can import the action.

75
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,470
For now everything is get so going to bring connect and then update site info.

76
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,420
All right.

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,510
Now of course a pre-populated we need to bring props and we can't import the prompts from a new reducer

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,940
in a new auction.

79
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,800
Right because now we have the site and they are now decide it's not products and it's not user.

80
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,050
So we will need to create a news pod for this so I'm going to do it right now and of course later we

81
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,900
can to use it.

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,720
So going to match state to prompts just like this going to lead the own prompts and the keyboard for

83
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,280
this is going to be site.

84
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,180
Then state that site.

85
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,310
All right so we don't have a file for this actions and we don't have them pretty much.

86
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,300
We don't have anything so let's created right now.

87
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm going to go to auctions and inside actions.

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,710
And you filed called side actions right.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,660
Or go when you file side actions that Jap's what's good.

90
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,390
So now just like the other ones going to bring the all the ones we need to import ASIO's just like this.

91
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,740
We need to import types.

92
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,790
For now I'm just going to import it and do this and later of course we're going to use it now.

93
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,070
Of course for now it's going to be empty so I'm going to comment.

94
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,000
And now we need to import the route where the site requests are going to go.

95
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,910
So if you remember we have this one inside components and then Minsk.

96
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,260
I'm going to go here to create a new Marvel called site server so we are pretty much doing the same

97
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,950
work we did with the other ones.

98
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,610
That's the only thing we are doing so we need to go to Eutelsat and misc.

99
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,490
So tells me go ask.

100
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,670
And of course I'm going to create a new place for this one.

101
00:06:51,930 --> 00:07:02,390
So export export then it Konst and then side server equals and we are going to go to.

102
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,490
Same thing than before.

103
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,600
API for Slash and for Slash and that site.

104
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,270
So we don't have this route and server.

105
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,500
We will need to create it.

106
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,850
But there are going to be the route it's really really simple.

107
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:21,000
All right so now we have the we have a site server so site server and that is going to work.

108
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,090
All right.

109
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,680
Now of course in a minute we're going to create the action.

110
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,040
But first we need to bring the we douceur to this.

111
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:35,120
So we're going to go to reducers when it opened the index of reducers and create a new file called side

112
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,490
reducer.

113
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,110
Yes.

114
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,120
So on this one on this section we're doing all the boring boring stuff.

115
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,660
But we need to do it.

116
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,460
There is no way around this.

117
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,730
So just like with the index I'm sorry with the actions we need to import types.

118
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,400
So I'm going to copy paste and from now empty.

119
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,850
Then of course we need to export a function.

120
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,440
It's going to go to a reducer I can accomplish pretty much everything.

121
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:12,240
And then of course delete it and maybe if you're on if you're saying Dude why are you not typing what

122
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,450
you can do.

123
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,530
You type everything that you build your application.

124
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,970
No not really OK.

125
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,200
So it looks looks OK.

126
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,480
Correct.

127
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,830
Now of course before we can begin we need at least maybe something that looks like a form right here

128
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,360
and we pretty much have everything we need inside register because we kind of already did this.

129
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,390
So we need the form state and the form data inside the state.

130
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,380
So I'm going to go right here and say state equals and then we get the form data with the form error

131
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,940
and everything else.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,510
And of course we will need to do a lot more right here.

133
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,100
So OK so what are we going to be using.

134
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:01,610
We're going to create a pod right here inside of our our server that it's going to be it's going to

135
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,270
be site.

136
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,670
And in this case is going to be sites and the site sites begin to have a different piece of information

137
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,810
just like the address the working hours the phone and the info always.

138
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,500
Right.

139
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,210
OK.

140
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:22,110
So what we're going to be pretty much using is again address hours phone and e-mail.

141
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,470
So we need to create a valid you know a valid form data that we can use.

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,630
So I'm going to go to the register and I'm going to copy this one.

143
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,060
And of course we're going to change it.

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,870
So this one is going to be address.

145
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,330
So address it is still an input.

146
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,880
It's not named Iput is going to be address input address.

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,030
And please enter the site address.

148
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,880
That's OK.

149
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,720
And again this is going to be valid false touched false.

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,840
And we can add that show label property show Leavell.

151
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,180
And this one is going to be true.

152
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,340
I'm not sure if we are really using the show label.

153
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,300
We're going to check it later.

154
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,210
That's OK.

155
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,030
OK.

156
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,820
I'm going to add a label right here.

157
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,140
We're going to use it and this one is going to be address.

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,870
All right.

159
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,950
Next one is the working hours.

160
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,630
So get a copy of this one pasted at the bottom and then I'm going to say.

161
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,340
Hours.

162
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,230
Hours.

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,790
OK.

164
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:33,260
So input address you know working hours and right here hours you know that this is boring but we need

165
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,880
to do it.

166
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,830
And inside hours or maybe working hours.

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,730
All right.

168
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,210
Next one is going to be the phone.

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:53,740
So phone copy paste is when it's going to be phone than working actually phone number.

170
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,640
And this one with the phone and enter the phone number

171
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,130
all right.

172
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,650
So we have one more to go which is the email of the website and everything is going to be true right

173
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,930
here with show Leavell going to show all.

174
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,750
So I'm going to cubbing phone are going to go here and say e-mail.

175
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,790
And now think about this instead of the register.

176
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,890
We do have an e-mail Sanch is going to copy that one.

177
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,840
Go to update site info.

178
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,130
Replace this one.

179
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,890
And the only thing we need to add right here is the show Leavell of true.

180
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:37,740
And then we just passed a label that says label open close and then shop e-mail or something like that.

181
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,800
Doesn't matter right now.

182
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,900
OK.

183
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,510
Get Burguet.

184
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,860
So now we have all the form data we need more thanks right here including the update form function.

185
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,520
So update form update form.

186
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,350
One thing less to do than we need to submit forms so submit form just get a copy go right here submit

187
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,700
form right inside if you're going to say console log and then data to submit.

188
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Right.

189
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,530
You know we did this many many times.

190
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,730
So this one is going to be site info.

191
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,520
Same thing with the old ones.

192
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,600
We are going to need that populate but we're going to do it later.

193
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,600
Because first we need a server or maybe a place where we can you know fetch the information about the

194
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,410
site.

195
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,140
Right.

196
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,890
All right.

197
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,360
OK.

198
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,090
That is good.

199
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,200
So let's create a form for this.

200
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,030
So we were going to use a div of course just like they were just for.

201
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,260
We need to copy the form and create a form.

202
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,180
Right.

203
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,720
So form.

204
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,500
So we will need four different form fields.

205
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,140
I'm going to copy the first one.

206
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,910
I'm going to copy the e-mail so I don't do it again.

207
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,100
And we can have four.

208
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,820
So the first one the second one the third one and the fourth one and I'm going to rearrange this so

209
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,630
you can look a little bit nicer for my selection.

210
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,470
Right.

211
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,100
So the first one it's the address.

212
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:16,810
So address just like this and address right here just like we have at the top address Burguet.

213
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,860
And I'm going to maybe close this ones.

214
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,340
Yeah that's it.

215
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,560
OK.

216
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,760
So the next one is going to be the hours so hours and same thing right here.

217
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,650
Now the phone and then phone what else we need e-mail we've already have it.

218
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,450
All right.

219
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,380
Get some going to go back to register.

220
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,330
And now we need the Budenz you know the Confirm error and form success and everything else.

221
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:52,460
So I'm going to go to this def and it copy the div and go back right here and I'm going to paste it

222
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,570
right.

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,310
And it's a dead format.

224
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,510
And then arrow label.

225
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,600
OK forget it.

226
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,040
You can show it in this instead of this one.

227
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,950
Create an account.

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,030
Well not really.

229
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,560
No it's going to be modify or update update it's a good word update.

230
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,580
And then we need the does that state that success.

231
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:21,440
So we don't have it on the register so that state that form success may find success if we do have something

232
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,140
that we do something if not we don't do anything.

233
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,180
And what we're going to do we just render a div just like this one and this one is going to be form

234
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,830
success form success and we're going to say chess success.

235
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,610
We are almost done the pain.

236
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,910
It's almost over.

237
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,640
All right.

238
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,000
OK.

239
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,340
We are done with you know the boring stuff.

240
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,480
Let me add a title because it looks weird to me without a title.

241
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,470
So let me go here and say one side info.

242
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,820
Right.

243
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,680
OK.

244
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,090
Looks a little bit better.

245
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,770
OK.

246
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,690
So we pretty much have everything we need right at least to show something right here.

247
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,590
Now when I enter to this modified site info I want to go to the server fetch whatever we have on the

248
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,160
on the database for site info.

249
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,860
Right.

250
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,700
And pre-populated right here.

251
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,730
Now the problem is that we don't have anything on our database.

252
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,810
We don't have anything.

253
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,730
And if we go to the models we don't have anything that says that talking about site info.

254
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,210
So this is what we need to do.

255
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,460
We need to create a model for the site.

256
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,080
Right.

257
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,960
So we can update modify values.

258
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,240
We need a route on the server where we can make the request to update or to you know get the site information

259
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,700
and we will need to add some dummy information at the least the first information on our application

260
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,930
that talks about about site.

261
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,270
So whenever we load the screen we're going to get the values and populate right here.

262
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,100
So let's go to the next section and we can go to the server and do all of this.

263
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,400
It's going to be very very simple.

264
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,710
Right.

265
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,460
Not that complicated.

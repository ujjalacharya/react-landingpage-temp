1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,730
OK so now we get it create the route so we can remove.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,100
So whenever we click we are going to remove it.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,040
Of course we need a route to do this.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,760
So first I'm going to create the route.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:20,390
So it's going to be a get route open and close that for Slash API for Slash users and remove from cart

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,740
or else we're going to use that Southmead aware and then we will run a function.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,080
And of course it's going to be request and response.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,830
Right.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,630
So what do we need to do.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,510
Of course you could just get the user from here.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,080
But again sometimes you don't get the users maybe you're just returning the idea of the user.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,440
So we need to find the user and do some updates inside of that user.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,530
So we entered the user model.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,790
Then we find one an update open and close if you remember we need to pass a few things.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,760
First is which user are we going to be updating.

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,490
So I'm going to say ID can.

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:04,280
And we past whenever we get back from the mouth malware which is a request that user underscore ID.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,760
All right.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,160
That's the first thing.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,670
Then the action that you can take in this case we already to push what we need to do is to remove something.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,210
So for this we use pull.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,070
Now then of course can and what pool needs is an object.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,230
So we're going to say this what are we going to be pulling.

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,240
So we're going to pull the full something from the cart so we say cart and then we pass an object.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,300
What are we going to be deleting from the cart.

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:42,200
Well whenever whatever document or piece of code you know entry that has an ID of something.

27
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,980
So again we are using mongoose type IDs inside the carts remember I'm going to copy mongoose types right

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,830
here sign or have to type it again and begin to search for whatever type we get from the from the route

29
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,110
you know from the client.

30
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,850
And remember that this route is going to be something like underscore ID equals to and you know the

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,670
idea of whatever they want to delete inside of the card of the user.

32
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:14,390
So we can have a get an inside request that query query that underscore ID in this case I'm going to

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,970
use underscore instead of ID.

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,380
OK.

35
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,630
So that is that after we make the changes I want the new state of the card off the user as a response

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,700
I don't want the old the old state of this.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,920
So if you want know do we need to do new and then true.

38
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,440
So we can get it and then come right at the end of this.

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,700
Of course we just run a callback function.

40
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,590
And I remember we told you before that you could do some logic on the server.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,080
Well the thing is that whenever we get the doc back this is the card of the user and on the card of

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,090
the user We just have some information we have pieces of information and we go to the cart.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,090
We have the we get the ID the quantity and the date.

44
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,670
So this is a problem because we cannot just return this if we return just this whenever we get it.

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,450
We need to dispatch a different action to get the articles date again.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,120
You know we need to trigger again get carte items with the new state of the user.

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,530
And you know we are already on the server.

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,290
Why not doing all of this logic from here whenever we remove the cart because the only place where we

49
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,430
can remove a card it's from here.

50
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,290
So whenever we go to this cart and we get the dog bag we're going to do some logic if we're going to

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,870
get the new state of all of these elements so what are we going to do.

52
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,170
We're going to grab the cart if we can go to Mungo's again and fetch all the data all the data from

53
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,640
here.

54
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,720
And then of course we will merge it.

55
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,350
OK.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,650
So just like we did here just like this this code we're going to do the same thing.

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,220
Not this code this code we are going to still do it right here on the actions.

58
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,270
But this one we can of course do it right here.

59
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,060
OK.

60
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,710
So first I'm going to create a virals called cart and I'm going to enter the document that we get back

61
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,000
from this usurp which is the card of the user and you enter the card.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,440
Right.

63
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,680
So now I have a volatile card called card.

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,260
With that then I'm going to create in an array led array equals I can loop the card.

65
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm going to say map opening close and for each one I'm going to get an item open and close.

66
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:34,510
So what I want back the same thing we did here we need the IDs ride just an RE with the IDs.

67
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,760
So I'm going to return and of course we need mongoose types.

68
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:48,680
So we're going to return whatever we get back when we get back from item that you know the card and

69
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,250
this I.D. It is going to be converted to object types.

70
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,390
So now what we can do we can grab this new array and pass it to mongoose so we can get all the data

71
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,820
we can need.

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,700
So product going to enter product that they're going to go right here at the bottom.

73
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,950
I mean just do it here.

74
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,450
I'm going to say find OK what do we want to find.

75
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:20,880
We want to find all the elements which underscore the inside products that matches the all the elements

76
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,930
we have inside the array.

77
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,870
So this is going to go to the server and kind of get it.

78
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:34,680
All right then remember that the rants and the woods are when we get on a deal with this elements so

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
we're going to do the same thing we did before.

80
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,970
Just get it.

81
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,500
Go and show you the coach that can really to this to populate and the brand.

82
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,510
So we're going to copy.

83
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,200
We're going to go and say I want to populate the brand and they would on this results as well.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,730
And then of course we execute something.

85
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,360
So exec.

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,370
Right.

87
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:02,940
So whenever we get a response of course of course we run a callback now error and then Card we're going

88
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,810
to get a card detail detail.

89
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,510
All right.

90
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:15,330
And now like I told before inside of the card right here we're going to get all the card details right.

91
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,980
All the products for the elements we have in the card for user and we still have access to cart inside

92
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,820
of here.

93
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,130
So if you wish you could do all this logic all this logic inside of here and then just return and you

94
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,190
Jason with all the data ready to go you could do that.

95
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,060
So we are not going to do this.

96
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,850
I'm not going to do it.

97
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:46,350
So I'm going to say return response to the status of two hundred and then we just send this Jaison response

98
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,320
right.

99
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,080
So the Jason response will contain the card detail which is all the data you know all the products detailed

100
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,760
product and I'm going to pass the cart as well.

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,760
So now that the action will receive all the card details and the new state of the cart that's why I'm

102
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,860
not going to do the same thing here.

103
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,640
I'm not going to pass.

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,270
Do you use a card from the client you're going to get it from the server.

105
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,620
Because at this point the idea that they deleted it's not here or I'm.

106
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,580
So we're going to loop this match this with the card detail and you know return whatever we want to

107
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,440
return.

108
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,660
All right that's good.

109
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,090
So for now the sort of a route it's done.

110
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,230
We don't need to do anything else.

111
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,070
Looks good.

112
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,430
Hopefully everything is OK.

113
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,720
So let's create an action for this.

114
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,600
It's going to go to the card component where we dispatched the action.

115
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,070
So of course we need to include it.

116
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,470
We don't have the function but it created right now.

117
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,580
So remove card item same as usual.

118
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,460
I'm going to copy the name and I'm going to go to user actions.

119
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:05,120
Going to create a type which is going to I'm going to call it how we should call it remove card item

120
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:12,010
user name remove the card item and then user.

121
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm using user because I'm using user and all the types.

122
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,690
So whenever it comes to user I attached user.

123
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,510
This is something I do if you wish.

124
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,260
Just doing remove card item.

125
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,380
That's OK.

126
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,580
So we have a new type.

127
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:42,230
We need to add it to the types so export Export Konst equals to remove card item user right.

128
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,930
OK that's good.

129
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,910
So now let me go to the user actions again.

130
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:55,170
So now we get this type we are going to copy the name of the function so we can create it at the bottom.

131
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,760
So export function export function.

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,040
Yep.

133
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,240
Card Room of card.

134
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,210
I'm opening clubs now from this one.

135
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:11,590
What we will be getting we will be passing is the idea of whatever we want to delete.

136
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,600
The server expects that information you know the id of whatever we want to delete.

137
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,970
So we need to pass the ID right.

138
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,520
So we say Id OK.

139
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,660
Now the request.

140
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:32,080
It's very simple to Konst request it calls X-post that get open and close and we are still going to

141
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,060
use the same user server we use either on the product server.

142
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:44,190
Then for Slash and the name of the route which is going to be removed from cart.

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,830
All right.

144
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,910
Oh sorry on this one it's user server because we are making a request to the user.

145
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,140
All right.

146
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,330
So it's user server or user route.

147
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,940
And then of course remove from cart.

148
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,440
OK.

149
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,330
So on this one we need to pass the ID and we are making a reference to this with underscore ID.

150
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:10,280
So we just pass the ID and that is it of course then we will get a new response so I'm going to do then

151
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,790
open and close and we get a response back from the server.

152
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,050
And when we do we just do something.

153
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,580
Now what we need to do looks pretty much just like that like this I'm going to still you know type it

154
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,480
all remember that from the server we get back the card detail and use date of card instead of the user.

155
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,030
Right.

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,520
OK.

157
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,410
So we need to do the same thing.

158
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:41,420
Rapid response that data entered the card and do a for each just like this and open and close on each

159
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,150
iteration.

160
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,200
We will be passing that item.

161
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,630
And then of course we run a function.

162
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,520
Now we're going to enter the child of card detail.

163
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:58,640
It's a response that data data then card detail just like this detail.

164
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,070
Open and close and Azari card detail.

165
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,160
And we do another for each so for each then open close and we just make sure I'm using card detail you

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,140
know same key word card it should be carte

167
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,790
cards.

168
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,660
The tail is going to fail.

169
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,730
And this one as well card detail.

170
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,450
All right.

171
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,830
So I'm going to go back and we're going to loop that card detail and for each and just like before we

172
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,190
need to catch the item and to iteration.

173
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,450
And I'm going to delete this one.

174
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,210
All right.

175
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,470
And then of course we run something where we need to check if the item of ID of the child equals the

176
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:47,010
item id of the parent or actually backwards if the item id of the parent matches the item id of the

177
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,690
child.

178
00:11:47,820 --> 00:12:00,180
And if it does we want to attach the quantity so responds that data Dadds card detail and then we pass

179
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,070
the iteration.

180
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,310
Let me close this so we can see the whole code.

181
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,930
So it's quantity.

182
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,180
Just like with it at the top.

183
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,180
So I'm going to copy this and paste it right here.

184
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,020
So the quantity of the card detail instead of the response we can attach quantity.

185
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,510
And then at the value and at the end.

186
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:26,720
Of course we return the response that data right.

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,170
Right.

188
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,230
So then we're going to do a return and we returned a new type and a payload.

189
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,830
Right.

190
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,450
So the payload is equal it's equal to whenever we get back from the request and the type it's removed

191
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,880
card item user almost done with the whole circuit.

192
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,810
All right.

193
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,450
OK.

194
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,870
So now we need to go to the reducer right.

195
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,050
I'm going to copy the type again just in case.

196
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,890
Go to the reducer and then just the type.

197
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,250
So what we need to do here.

198
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,600
It's pretty much the same then.

199
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,570
You know get cart item user.

200
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,430
The thing is that from the server we are getting the card detail and a new cart.

201
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,260
Right.

202
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,050
OK.

203
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,890
And we need to from this card we need to go to the users store to the state and turn the user data and

204
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,930
turn that card and update this cart.

205
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,760
That's why we are also passing the cart.

206
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,920
We are updating several things with the same dispatch.

207
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,840
So use a reduced or remove card item and do coma.

208
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,850
And if the case.

209
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,610
Oh sorry not coma if the case is removed card item.

210
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,640
We're going to do something so we return just it's always dot dot dot.

211
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,480
And then the state and then coma and I'm going to do this just like this.

212
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,210
So it's a little bit easier to read.

213
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,780
So we're going to enter the cart and detail and begin going to say that the card didn't tell now it's

214
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:02,390
equal to action that payload that card detail.

215
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,710
All right looks good hopefully no mistakes that begin to use the Enter the user data.

216
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,160
Remember that we use the user data right here.

217
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,410
And let me make sure I'm using cart cart detail Yeah it's card detail.

218
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,930
Maybe I made a mistake in using card with a D.

219
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,550
That's OK.

220
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,810
It should be OK.

221
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,250
So I'm going to enter inside the user data.

222
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm going to put inside of the user data whenever we get inside user data.

223
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,170
Rhydwen have all the information we get from user data but I want to modify the card.

224
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,870
So I do a coma and a change to cart.

225
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:46,250
So action that payload that cart that is that we're going to update the card details whenever we remove

226
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:52,610
one item with a new state of this and then we do the same thing with the user data and the card of the

227
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,360
user data should be OK.

228
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,110
Let's try out.

229
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,920
So we need to go to that function.

230
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,990
Remember when we click it right here and we go to this function.

231
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,060
So what we do is a device that prompts that dispatch to open it close.

232
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:16,790
And then of course the name of the function the action.

233
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,000
So remove card item remember that we need to pass the ID.

234
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,950
So we are going to be passing the ID so Id And then of course we get a response back.

235
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm going to go right here and say then oops then open and close.

236
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,690
We're going to run a function.

237
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,820
Open it close and then we do something.

238
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,740
Now we have two scenarios.

239
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,700
The first one is what happens if the user id sort of the user just they have maybe just one item right

240
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,250
here.

241
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,610
If we remove that single item the card data is going to be empty.

242
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,250
Right.

243
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,110
So we changed the show Teutul back to false.

244
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,800
So we can you know remove the show total right here.

245
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,860
It's going to be total amount zero anyways but we need to remove this item so we can end it the way

246
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:15,480
we need a way to check if the user has zero card elements zero card products inside the card detail.

247
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,340
Or maybe one or more.

248
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,320
So if open it close.

249
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:31,070
So if this prompts that user that card detail that length is less or equal than zero then we're going

250
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,530
to do see said state this.

251
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:45,500
That said state and we changed the state to show total to false.

252
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,520
Now of course if they are deleting an item and they have more items.

253
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,260
Of course we will maybe just delete this item but they still have one.

254
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,930
So we need to recalculate the total amount.

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,280
Told you we are going to use this Kancheli total function.

256
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,980
So what we do we just do the same thing does that calculate total.

257
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,110
And we need to pass the card detail that we get in this that prompts a user.

258
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,730
This version of course.

259
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:19,080
So I'm going to go and since everything is updated again it passed a new state of card detail and it

260
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,090
should be working.

261
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,730
So let's check it out.

262
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,610
OK.

263
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,550
So I'm going to remove the first one and then we can have.

264
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,970
We are removing everything.

265
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,860
Let me just reload the application.

266
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,090
And we are actually not removing from the server.

267
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,950
So I'm going to go here and just make sure let me open it I'm going to go to council and see what we

268
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,480
get and we get local hosts removed from court not found.

269
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,250
And this is because of a mistake with the route.

270
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,210
I'm pretty sure if this remove from card for four.

271
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,230
So let's go back.

272
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,780
API user remove from card.

273
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:06,800
So user actions get removed from a cart user's server.

274
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,050
Or by this I'm pretty sure that this is just a silly mistake.

275
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,080
So remove.

276
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,470
And we can get it.

277
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,630
So let me just think for a minute and find a problem.

278
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:27,330
Of course it's users have made this mistake before.

279
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,780
All right.

280
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,410
You know a lot of code man.

281
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,410
So again talking and doing and watching not so easy it's like going to reload the application and try

282
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,830
again this time should work because the only thing that was wrong was the request.

283
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,200
So we get it we remove it and we get it.

284
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,100
If we load the application and notice that it's recalculating.

285
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,870
If I reload the application everything is good.

286
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,630
Now we have the new state of this.

287
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,450
So if I remove it we should be getting the face of.

288
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,360
You have no items.

289
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,770
You know the sad face.

290
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,640
So remove.

291
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,220
You have no items going to go back to guitars.

292
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm going to add it again two at three at four.

293
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,810
Go to my car and we get it and we are recalculating.

294
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,760
Let me delete this one.

295
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,590
There we go.

296
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,550
I'm going to do this one and we just get one and do it again.

297
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,310
All right.

298
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,350
So everything works.

299
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,840
So far everything works.

300
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
So I'm going to add more of this.

301
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,250
So what do we need to do now.

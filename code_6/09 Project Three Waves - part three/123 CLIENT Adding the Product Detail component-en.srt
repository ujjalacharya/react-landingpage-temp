1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,490
All right.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,140
So let's keep going with this.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,730
I was going to I was going to do the site info and then the using information.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,400
But again they are just like the products in the magic of magic category.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,120
And I wanted to do something a little bit more fun.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,970
So what are we going to be doing is that whenever we click on the product we're going to get.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,380
Of course the information about the product and everything else and where we click and of course we

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,770
get the thumbnails and everything else right.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,660
And then after we're finished this we're going to go directly to the card logic and you know adding

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,210
everything to the user card.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,090
And then of course make it the purchase.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,650
So let's begin with this.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,860
If I go to guitars right here this is the one we made previously.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,870
And if I go of course go to bew product nothing happens.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,710
But if we remember and I go to Mongo DVH on this entry we have three images so we can work with that.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,060
If you don't have this please try to go to the admin and add maybe at least two images at least two

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,940
images if you're going to add more.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,720
That's cool.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,200
All right.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,820
Let's begin with this.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,390
So what do we need first.

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,310
First we need a road where we can render by catching the idea.

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,930
Right.

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,680
OK.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,730
So I'm going to go to source.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,540
Let me close everything else.

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,490
And we're going to start this on it's own component.

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,260
I'm going to create a new folder and this one will be called Product singler.

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,700
And of course we will get an Index index that as instead of they're going to press enter and this is

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,370
going to be a re-act classmates component.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,490
And now of course I'm going to say product right here.

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,040
We're going to make some changes of course and I'm going to go to route's because of course we need

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,510
to include it inside.

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:50,850
ROBERTS So I'm going to import and I'm going to call the component product just like this.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,840
And that page could be product detail or something like that.

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,470
It's completely up to you.

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,760
And there's when it's inside components for last and that product right I'm going to copy the name I

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,320
got to replace and that's for with a product page.

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,030
And of course and then we need to include it.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,300
And this one will be kind of a public scenario so I'm going to copy and paste it.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,880
And the your L is of course is going to change.

42
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,860
So I'm going to change the component and the Ural is going to be something like I don't know a full

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,350
force would be something like product or part of detail that makes sense.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,950
Yeah.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,250
So I'm going to call it product and then detail.

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,140
And of course we need to catch DJT.

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,420
If you remember we need to call in and the name of what we are going to be catching in this case is

48
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:47,490
the idea SOGA are going to save it and in theory we've already added this part of detail.

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,700
So if I go here of course let me go back to be Tarz if I go to the product we get a dashboard.

50
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,050
This is my mistake because of course this is a product detail and we are setting this to false ride.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,050
So this one it's a public just like shop and home so it should be Nouel at least we know that the logic

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,380
with the preventing route is working.

53
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,690
So I go to the product and we get products.

54
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,460
All right.

55
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,980
So let's go to the index.

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,440
And of course we need to include a lot of things right here.

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,910
We're going to divide everything into three or three different components which is this is the main

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,350
one.

59
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,440
And then we're going to have the we're going to get the left with the image and then the right side

60
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,000
we're going to do first the right and then the image because this one has a light box.

61
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,780
So we have a little bit more logic right there.

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,920
So I'm going to go right here and say first I want to include the page top.

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,350
This is the page up.

64
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,040
They weren't Would it be before right here.

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
So we will really have this.

66
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:55,920
So I'm going to imported the import page top from Dot dot dot for slash your tails for Slash and then

67
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,840
page top right.

68
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,560
OK.

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:07,860
What else we need to connect because whenever we get the ID of this product connect whenever we get

70
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,900
the idea of this product we need to of course go to fetch the information.

71
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,430
So it's from react and then redux.

72
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,410
OK am I going to go right here and we're going to say of course we need to import actions.

73
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,270
So for now of course we are not going to import anything because we need to create the actions and we

74
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,570
need some user actions and some products actions.

75
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,790
So for now we are good now.

76
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,390
I'm going to do.

77
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,270
I'm going to grab the connect connect open and close and then wrap the actual component.

78
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,290
All right now we're going to use Map state props.

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:51,210
So I'm just going to go right now and say map state prompts and we will use the products so products

80
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,380
and then products right here.

81
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,810
All right.

82
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,140
And of course inside of the connect Burguet.

83
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,440
So let's begin with this.

84
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,590
First we need to fetch the information about this product on the server later are we going to do some

85
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:04,970
changes.

86
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,340
But for now we are just going to fetch the information.

87
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,200
So a component did mount open and close and we can open it.

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:22,170
So I'm going to say Konst ID equals and to get the ID from the Paramus is this that probs that match

89
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,380
that prompts that idea.

90
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,840
Remember we kind of already did this.

91
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:34,210
So then of course I went to dispatch in action which is going to be the you know the get product detail.

92
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,280
First I want to console log the console log that and getting the correct ID you know that we are getting

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:51,000
the ID so I can inspect are going to go to bew product and we get the idea that is get our Burguet.

94
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,200
So of course we need to create this patch and then of course go to the reducers So we need to go to

95
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
actions.

96
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,400
And this one is going to be a product action Zangana open actions and save the index.

97
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,040
Okay.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,300
So inside product actions we need to create a type which is going to be a get product detail just like

99
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,620
that.

100
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:23,710
So lets do it right now going to do a coma and then get a mic get it right get for product underscore

101
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,420
detail and then and again to create it.

102
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,250
Right now we can create a clear product detail.

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,020
Remember we told you that whenever we fetched information story redux and we go outside we should clear

104
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:41,440
the state of this global state because if we enter again we're going to see a flashing information of

105
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,920
the previous state.

106
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,080
So I'm going to create it right now.

107
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,240
We're going to start with clear than product and that detail.

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,710
All right.

109
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,970
Pretty good.

110
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,620
So now I'm going to copy this and I'm going to do this at the top.

111
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:07,930
So export export function and we're going to call it get product and the detail and with this one we'll

112
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,230
be getting an ID and then of course we need to do something.

113
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,620
Now if you remember on the server we already have this information.

114
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,170
Let me find it I believe we call it good product by ID or something like that.

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,780
So our articles by ID.

116
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,620
So this is one we are using right and we are listening for Crace and we need to pass a type of single

117
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,490
if we want to get a single one.

118
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:30,730
All right.

119
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:38,590
So at least we know what the route is so we're going to carry the request Konst request equals ASIO's

120
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:47,740
that get and then we just pass the same you r l which is product server just like this forward slash.

121
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,000
And its going to be products my ID right.

122
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,170
So its actually articles by id write articles by ID so articles by ID.

123
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:05,980
So we need to pass the query string so its all the closes its ID equals to whatever ID we get from the

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,730
from the arguments and then the type so ampersand and type.

125
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,860
And in this case its a single right.

126
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,700
That is it.

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,970
Then of course we need to catch the response response.

128
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:30,010
The Rigaud opening close and what we need to return is the response so Im going to say return responds

129
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,730
that data.

130
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,400
All right.

131
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,480
Now again the information comes in the inside of an array.

132
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,350
Right it comes inside of something.

133
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,270
So I'm going to do I want to get whatever we have inside and just put it inside of that.

134
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,520
So whenever we get the information on the index we could just make a reference to the Propst product

135
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,300
and the name of what we want to bring.

136
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:50,810
Right.

137
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,690
OK.

138
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,100
So this one is good.

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,640
We need to return to type.

140
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:09,650
So type sorry return we do the type of course open close and then payload Collen right.

141
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,970
So the type its get product detail and what we will we will send it whatever we get back from the request.

142
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,470
So we need to add these types because we really need to add them.

143
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,450
So I'm going to go again to copy and do both.

144
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,940
So right.

145
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:33,450
So export Export Konst and the first one was get product detail right.

146
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,710
Let's do that one.

147
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,980
So get product detail and then we close it.

148
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,640
And the same thing for the other one.

149
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,170
So export Konst clear product detail and then include your product detail.

150
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,630
All right so now we get the types Burguet.

151
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,220
So of course if I go to Protech actions I made a mistake right here and they put a comma.

152
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,580
Now when did you go to the producer Ron.

153
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,500
We need to do to catch this types from the reducer So let's go to the reduce or so product reduce or

154
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,500
of course we need to import the types I'm going to copy this once and then paste it at the top.

155
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,300
Very good.

156
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,770
So now on the get product detail we just create a case recopy the type get product Gitau going to go

157
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:30,760
right here at the bottom and say if the case is that we get a product detail we want to return that

158
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:37,410
Dudden state coma and we want to return something that has the detail.

159
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,170
So the key for this is going to be Prod. detail.

160
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:50,030
CONAN And whenever we get inside action that payload now we get to meet or go like it like this a little

161
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,580
bit more.

162
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,630
If we get the case that we want to clear the plot the product detail we pretty much do the same thing

163
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:05,970
so clear product detailed case clear product detail and we just returned pretty much the same thing.

164
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,820
The difference is that this time the action that the load is going to be nothing.

165
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,100
We are not going to get anything inside of the payload is going to create a function right now.

166
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:25,070
So we can get it out of the way to go at the bottom and say export function and clear product detail

167
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:38,110
open and close and we just return a type of clear product detail the type of the top and the type clear

168
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,340
product detail and the payload could be anything you know could be an empty array could be an empty

169
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,880
object or just going to say empty string.

170
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,270
So now we have two functions.

171
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,670
So again we go to index and Im going to require them from the actions right.

172
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,580
So important open and close and then get.

173
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,930
I have I here get part of the detail and just to avoid typos Im going to copy the name.

174
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,470
All right.

175
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,970
So then of course we need to required from dot dot for Slashdot that for Slash and then actions and

176
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,150
then products of product actions.

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,480
All right.

178
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,140
We are kind of ready to go.

179
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,340
So we need to first dispatch to get product detail right.

180
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,090
Whenever we do component mounts we do get the ID.

181
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:34,620
So I'm going to say this that prompts that dispatch and we passed the get product detail with the actual

182
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,090
ID.

183
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,870
So now the page is going to reload and of course nothing happens.

184
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,190
But if we go here we should be getting that product detail and we do state products product detail and

185
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,470
we get you know the three images and everything else we now have this is the only entry with three images

186
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,450
so we know that this is a one.

187
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,050
OK.

188
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,160
So now we get it.

189
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,920
Now of course look at this.

190
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,580
If I go to home and I check in again the product details stays there.

191
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,020
Right.

192
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,520
We still get it.

193
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:12,030
So if I go again to that post until we finished a network request that product details stays the same

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,490
always stays the same and whenever it's done then it's going to go and replace it for the new one if

195
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,270
you're going to a different ID.

196
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:25,980
That's why we do clear product detail and what we're going to be doing whenever this component and mounts

197
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,190
component will and mount we will trigger that part detail.

198
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,510
So there's not a problem that this patch and this action is instant.

199
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,910
It's actually very very quick because we are not making a request of the server.

200
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,730
We are just modifying the store and that's it.

201
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:52,320
So now instead get part of detail inside the actual product the detail we get all the information about

202
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,410
the about the components.

203
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,220
So let's try to build something right here so we can at least get something.

204
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,830
So going to delete products and first thing and add the page top we've included at the top.

205
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,370
And if you remember we need to pass a title if not nothing going to is going to get us played.

206
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,200
So title equals and then product detail Okay.

207
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,780
So then I'm going to wrap everything inside of a container.

208
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,700
All right.

209
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,410
Now the thing is that the first time the page loads we will not and we are not going to get anything

210
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,030
called prok detail.

211
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:38,060
So of course we need to ask if we do have something so this that props that products just like this

212
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,680
dot and then private detail.

213
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,530
So there's that props up products that detail if you do have something we're going to do something if

214
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,500
not we're going to return no or what you can do.

215
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,510
And I'm not going to do it right now to save time.

216
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,490
I'm going to return loading.

217
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,720
So right here we could show that materail you I circle or progress.

218
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm not going to do it.

219
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,800
So we can save a little bit of time but you know this is how we do it.

220
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,580
So instead of if we do have some information I want to show something on the screen.

221
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,100
Right.

222
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:17,560
So I'm going to show a wrapper of class name and then product then detail and then wrap her.

223
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,060
And instead of here we will get two sites left with images and the light box and the right side with

224
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,700
the info.

225
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:34,050
So div class name of the left and this one we're going to be the actual images whatever.

226
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,220
And then in the ride we will get the.

227
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,040
Of course the data we can do right now.

228
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,520
So class name right.

229
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,230
OK.

230
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,720
So in sort of here and we're going to the info of course we're going to do a couple more things.

231
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:00,050
But you know we can if we can get it we get images in left and then the info in the center.

232
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,550
I'm pretty sure I made a mistake with this should be container right.

233
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,650
That's why it's all the way to the left.

234
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,210
OK so now we got it in the center.

235
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,940
So then part of detail wrapper.

236
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,260
Everything looks nice.

237
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,510
Of course when we start adding things we're going to modify the sizes right here but that's good.

238
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,160
So first we're going to do the info one.

239
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,870
Right.

240
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,000
So for this one we need a new component to get a pass I think is Propst.

241
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,280
And then of course we can show the information.

242
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,160
So this component I'm going to create Right now I'm going to call it prod info or something like that

243
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,510
would AFO prod and info and then that G-S.

244
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,640
All right to save it so would prod and info.

245
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,780
The only thing we need to do is to catch the prompts and display some Jande sex.

246
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,410
So this one could be a reactive state stateless component just like this.

247
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,950
And I'm going to call it prod and foe with a capital P.

248
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,250
So we are good.

249
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,360
So of course we need to import a lot of things and right from the start we will need a button.

250
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,780
We have buttons right here.

251
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,890
So I'm going to import my button from Eutelsat and then button.

252
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,570
All right.

253
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,630
Actually it's button we will use Fonte awesome icon.

254
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,510
So import phantasm font.

255
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,990
Awesome icon from that weird name for it.

256
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,710
Awesome and re-act for awesome.

257
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,860
OK now let me try try to go to the find one so we will get this icons.

258
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,320
If it's a free shipping we can it show something.

259
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,950
If not begin to show something else.

260
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,990
Of course then we have an X.

261
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,790
And we can have some something else if we're going to import three different icons.

262
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,010
They're going to say import and I get to create the first one and then just we can copy and paste of

263
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,550
course.

264
00:17:52,790 --> 00:18:01,120
So import a and then truck from at and it's Fortt awesome.

265
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,300
And this is the one the free solid.

266
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,220
So a truck.

267
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,180
All right.

268
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,090
And that's it I'm going to copy this one because it's pretty much the same.

269
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,010
The only thing that changes is the name.

270
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:19,790
And then we add check because we get checkmark or simple enough going to copy.

271
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,980
I'm going to paste and I'm the last one.

272
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,530
It's times all right.

273
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,130
So we have to get all the icons.

274
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,180
There are no more imports for this section.

275
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,380
So instead of the Prod. info we will be getting props right.

276
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,780
Right.

277
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,580
OK.

278
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,180
So now the bottom what I want to do on the actual one and whenever we render something we have three

279
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,880
different places we have you know the description the title and this.

280
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,100
Then we have a place where we show the price and we can add a card and then we have the specifications.

281
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,700
So what I want to do instead of here just instead of just returning everything I want to retry and return

282
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,290
three different functions where we can you know split the content.

283
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,470
So I get inside the return inside of the div..

284
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,690
First I'm going to put the title.

285
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,610
So it's prop's Oh sorry.

286
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,700
Let me make it right to access the title.

287
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,190
So proud props that detail.

288
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:25,190
And you know now that I think about it we could you know store this Konst detail equals props that detail

289
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,380
so we don't have to make a reference to props.

290
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,860
We just can say detail and that is it.

291
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,730
So whenever we called a detail we access the brand and art we access the name.

292
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:44,710
I remember that then we have the name of the the actual article no fender what Fender Stratocaster or

293
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,200
what what we're going to be using.

294
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:55,210
So props out sort detail dot name and in future we should be getting something let's double check.

295
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,120
Of course we need to include it.

296
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,070
So I'm going to go to the top and import Perrott info.

297
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:12,580
We call it info signed copy prod info from that forward slash and then Prof ampho.

298
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,810
And of course we need to when to put it right here and we need to pass a prompt.

299
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,000
If not of course we are not going to get anything.

300
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,470
Sorry forgot to do this.

301
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,610
So I'm going to call.

302
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,110
I'm going to put two things.

303
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,390
The first one is the detail.

304
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:33,210
You know what we need to pass to the component so this that prompts the products dot and then prod detail.

305
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,500
Which is what we get on the read of the store later much later when we are pretty much done with done

306
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,160
with this.

307
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,740
We're going to do the Add to Cart.

308
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,840
So we need to kind of a trigger function that adds this item to the cart of the user.

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,670
So I'm going to call it out to cart and then add to cart.

310
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,730
And this one is going to be equal to a function.

311
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,790
Now this function will be getting the ID of the element and then I'm going to say this dot at current

312
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,630
just like this.

313
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,420
Add to Cart and we make it ride.

314
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:16,060
So add two and then cart and then handler open and close and we just pass the ID and passing the ID

315
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,330
from the child component because we are sure that we handle only one information because maybe later

316
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,800
you're going to get I don't know some other data right here maybe you going to get something else.

317
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,240
So again it's better to pass the ID for get idea from the child.

318
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,500
All right.

319
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,740
So we get the title.

320
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,890
I have an s r g.

321
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,940
Two fifty five.

322
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,310
So that is get we get the title or nothing.

323
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,450
We are getting the data correctly at least right.

324
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,470
So then we have a description going to do something very simple.

325
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm going to put it put it a paragraph then detail dot and then description and we should be getting

326
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,640
the description OK.

327
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,180
So we get it.

328
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,530
Let me see the.

329
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,100
All right.

330
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,710
I'm way past the time.

331
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,190
So this is get we get the title and we get the text.

332
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,960
So let's go to the next section and do everything else is going to be really really simple.

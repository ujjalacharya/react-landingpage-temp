1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,740
All right so now we are going to be working with the paypal button and.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,070
OK.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,960
So what is the first thing we need.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,300
We need a Paypal account.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,350
This is going to be an account that I don't use.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,540
It's just empty.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,560
So I'm going to log in first of course you need to register and everything else and then trying to log

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,100
in of course I'm going to log into mine as well as a dummy account.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,050
So once you log in of course you're going to get all the information right here.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,950
Now to use a connector because we can use a connector to pay.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,840
We need a business account.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,050
It's not going to work with a personal account and it's because whenever we're going to go to a different

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,380
place inside Paypal inside Paypal developer we get a dashboard to of course work with the codes and

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,530
you use an API and everything else and the tokens will not work if you don't have a business account.

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,830
So you of course need to upgrade to business and it's free of course it's free.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,090
The only thing with Paypal is that they charge you after you of course you create a transaction or something

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,890
like that.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,760
So you will need to upgrade to business.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,320
And of course if you go right here to the to the settings you're going to get all the information inside

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,990
settings.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,580
And then if you go here you'd say upgrade to a business account.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,660
And of course they're going to ask you a lot of questions.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,110
What is the business.

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,360
And then continue.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,100
And of course you will need to complete all of this until you get your you know your fake business account

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,010
is going to be a real business account.

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,260
But right now we're going to be using to use this to practice Of course.

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,570
All right.

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,060
So I'm going to I'm going to close this.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm going to go to you go back to pay pal.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:51,190
Well I'm going to close it and of course I already have a real paypal account so let me log in first

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,370
and I'm going to show you.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,070
So once you read your business account you can get a bunch of extra options you know add to your website

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,860
in line in Bogey's invoicing and everything else.

35
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,090
And of course if you go right here to settings you're going to get the business set up and profile settings

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,110
and everything else even you get the business name if you get.

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,970
Again this is because the business account it's ready now now this is actually where we don't want to

38
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,590
be.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,840
We need to go to a different place to go and say Pay Pal developer just like that.

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,470
And he said pay velt developer once again since we are already logged in a dry here you're going to

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,090
get right here the connector if not of course you will need to log in with the same account.

42
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,120
And of course then you go to dashboard and this is where we care right now instead of dashboard you

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,320
get a bunch of things including a sandbox account.

44
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,820
You get this with the sandbox.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,030
It's just like Mongo on mongoose on the on the server.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,110
We get a sunburst we get a place where we can you know do some testing.

47
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,790
Right.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,270
So if I go to sandbox and it go to accounts of course we get a lot of information of what's happening

49
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,680
and you get this whenever you get a sample of a sandbox account you get to fake users.

50
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,590
One is the facilitator which is going to be you know the register business.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,040
Right.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,130
Is going to be us.

53
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,210
And then you get the.

54
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,290
Of course the same name and the buyer so buyer it's declined right.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,990
Is the the people that the person that is going to go in and make the purchase.

56
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,900
So whenever we make a purchase with pay pal with fake pay.

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,320
Of course if we're going to use this personal buyer account and this account by default we get like

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,850
I don't know.

59
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,010
Thirty thousand dollars.

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,400
So we can make purchases and do some testing and of course we get a lot of things.

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,030
Now if we go to profile

62
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,980
it's a little slow.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,030
If you go to a profile we get all the settings you know funding right here.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,140
Vallence 4900 a lot of money man then Baeza And you know a number and everything else you know everything

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,770
is fake.

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,690
Of course if you go to profile of course we get the address and everything else.

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,730
So right here you'll need to change your password or select a different password.

68
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,410
I'm going to do our password one two three password one two three.

69
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm going to save it.

70
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,420
Of course.

71
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,610
So we can do it.

72
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,420
OK what am I going to do.

73
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:21,910
All right.

74
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:28,180
Let me just think I'm going to do testing one two three.

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,740
All right.

76
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:30,820
All right.

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,810
So now the passwords.

78
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,860
Testing one two three.

79
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,520
We should be changing the other one as well.

80
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,100
Profile and of course use the same passport.

81
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,510
Testing one two three going to save it.

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,200
OK so we get an error message.

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,330
Let me see if I can save it again.

84
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,790
Going to cancel close profile

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,350
and testing one two three right.

86
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,710
OK.

87
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,430
Well let's go.

88
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,540
I'm going to try later and see why we are getting this error message.

89
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,830
But don't worry for now we are not going to really use the facilitator.

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,650
The one we care right now is the buyer one that we're going to check the other one.

91
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,280
OK.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,410
So once you get this you're pretty much ready to go.

93
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,260
There's one more thing we need to do.

94
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:30,030
If you go to my apps and credentials you get a lot of options right here different tokens you know and

95
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,960
we're going to use this one.

96
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,250
You notice the drink here I'm already using it from before I.

97
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,920
Our final project my final project and what we will need to do is create an app and with this one you

98
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,620
will get a token we can use right here with the sandbox so we can make the purchase.

99
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,760
So I'm going to do it right now I'm going to create the app and I'm going to give it the name of waves

100
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,560
and notice that the sandbox developer account is still facilitator.

101
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,500
So OK so going to create the application.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,050
And of course you get you get some information of course what you can do.

103
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,260
People here along it would pay pal and everything else.

104
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,580
So right.

105
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:18,620
So people out here we actually don't need this one and this one we will need it and that's it.

106
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,730
And out at the top we're going to save it of course.

107
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,140
And at the top what we will need to do is to get this information this is what we need.

108
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,550
They give you a token and whenever we make the purchase from here we go to the connector and connect

109
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,480
to pay pal.

110
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,330
We need the actual token.

111
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:36,950
Right.

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,900
So I'm going to copy this right here and I'm going to go to our cart going to make a comment right here

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,390
at the top and I'm going to leave it there because we're going to use it later.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,600
And then of course you get a secret and this is no.

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,720
A little bit more important because whenever you go to production it doesn't matter for now.

116
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,580
OK.

117
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,660
So I'm going to I'm going to leave this open after a couple minutes is going to lock me out for of course

118
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,220
security reasons.

119
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,990
But again we are using a sandbox.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,650
So nothing is going to really happen.

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,280
It doesn't matter if someone copies this token.

122
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,720
Right.

123
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,290
OK.

124
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,490
So OK so I'm going to go to our application to go back to our application and first before we can use

125
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,400
the connector we need to do a lot of things we need to create a reusable component for the button.

126
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,120
And you know just prepare our component to get the prompts from this one.

127
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,670
Right so let's create reusable components.

128
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,730
I'm going to go to you tell us and I'm going to create a new file called Pay-Pal.

129
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes.

130
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,410
All right.

131
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,800
So this one will be a re-act class based component.

132
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,210
And of course Paypal let me just change it.

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,860
Pay-Pal with a capital P.

134
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,940
OK.

135
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,510
So right now we are not going to really use this first we're going to include the Paypal but and so

136
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,360
right now I'm going to say just Pay-Pal right.

137
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,480
And if you're asking yourself Why am I using Paypal and it's because people can be used pretty much

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,480
through out the globe.

139
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,190
We have tons of connectors you could use PayPal in your business where your client may be using paypal

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,050
you have a lot of other options.

141
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,270
A lot of options.

142
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,340
They all Tarsh something after you use it.

143
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,050
So it's pretty much the same thing.

144
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:27,430
And but you always use a service to of course process payments into your into your of course application.

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,380
Right.

146
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,850
So let's go back to the cart.

147
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,930
I'm going to go right here and import of course the pay public and begin to use it.

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:45,970
So import than PayPal from dot dot for Slash utils for Slash and then pay pal.

149
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,590
Right.

150
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,440
So going to copy I'm going to go at the bottom and I'm going to put it where are people but an S.

151
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,200
Right.

152
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,010
So I'm going to say Pay-Pal open and close.

153
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,100
So of course we need to pass a lot of props.

154
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,170
So what are going to be the props.

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,900
All right.

156
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,940
So first we need to tell this paper people how much the user needs to pay.

157
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,300
And if you remember we have it on the total right here.

158
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,550
All right on the state.

159
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,160
So I'm going to say to pay equals to this that state that total.

160
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:20,990
Right.

161
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,550
OK I'm going to go at the bottom and I'm going to say OK what can happen.

162
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,030
Whenever you know the user makes intersection and we get an error.

163
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,470
OK.

164
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:38,310
So I'm going to pass a prompt that says trans section trans section and then error equals.

165
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,720
And of course from the connector from the people we're going to get a lot of data so I'm going to be

166
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,000
grabbing that data and then pass it to a function.

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,400
We will create right here to this transaction error and I'm going to pass this data.

168
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,960
Now of course we don't have this function going to create it right here at the top and just you know

169
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,460
live it empty.

170
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,810
You're going to use it much much later.

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,950
All right then we have a different scenario what happens if the transaction gets canceled.

172
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,900
Maybe the user reaches the final stage and they just you know cancel everything they're going to do

173
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,640
the same thing.

174
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,040
So Trinh S..

175
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,120
Let me just copy and paste.

176
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm going to copy paste Antrix S.S. canceled

177
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,960
right and same thing for this transduction counsel and copy and paste and we will create the function

178
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,930
at the top and then of course we going to catch it open and close.

179
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,430
And that is it.

180
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,560
And the final state is going to be on success.

181
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:46,380
So I'm going to say on success what's going to happen if the user completes the you know the purchase.

182
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:53,430
So we're going to get data and then of course we will run a new function called this and then transduction

183
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,830
success something like that.

184
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,930
And then of course we are going to be receiving data.

185
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,550
And we do the same thing at the top.

186
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,510
So transduction success equals to a function.

187
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,710
Right okay.

188
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,630
So pretty much we have everything we need the amount to be paid.

189
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,390
And of course what happens when you get when we get an error when we get when it get canceled or when

190
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,760
everything goes OK.

191
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,680
Right.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,700
So let's go to the Pay-Pal connector on to the Paypal component and right here we're going to use a

193
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,090
connector we're going to use a third party library.

194
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,590
So if you go right here and you are just trying to find re-act people express out.

195
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,470
I'm on the NPM could go you know to get help that we have here.

196
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,300
As a matter let's go to get help.

197
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
When not.

198
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:45,750
OK.

199
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,660
So first of course you need to install it.

200
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,000
But if we remember we make a little memory right here.

201
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,980
We've already have it re-act people express checkout.

202
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,610
So we don't need to install it.

203
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,410
All right.

204
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,160
So this is very simple very very simple.

205
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,010
You just use the component they are going to give you and you will need to pass all the prompts just

206
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,300
right from the beginning.

207
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,080
We need this you know we need the the the tokens so for of course they give you a box and they give

208
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,030
you a production of course you can get the production much much later.

209
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,000
Whenever you go to production.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,720
So OK so the sandbox and we need to put creative are all called sandbox and put the token right there.

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:24,980
Right.

212
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,170
And then of course we going to be passing this to the button now and this is the important part whenever

213
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,510
you of course you complete they complete the purchase and everything else we're going to get on unsuccess

214
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,950
scenario an on console and an error.

215
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,060
You know the same elements we were using from the parent component right from this one.

216
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,870
Right.

217
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,450
So and then of course we need to pass the environment with is sandbox the currency of what we are using.

218
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,480
And you know the total amount.

219
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,010
Right.

220
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,540
OK.

221
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,250
So it's kind of a it's really really simple.

222
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,260
So let's go back.

223
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,210
We're going to go to the table and of course we need to do a few things.

224
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,130
So I'm to make a little bit of space right here.

225
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,190
And actually we don't need it because we need it inside of the render.

226
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,080
This is what they give you on the example.

227
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm going to do it on same way.

228
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,760
All right.

229
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,990
So inside the render what we need to do to create these deep virals in this case Konst on success.

230
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,180
And notice just like before.

231
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm trying to do this example the same way they did.

232
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,340
So you later of course you can read the documentation and you know no difference right here.

233
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,660
So of course unsuccess you get it you're going to get some data back.

234
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,670
So I'm going to say payment.

235
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,390
Right.

236
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,460
And of course you do something much later than we have uncancel so Konst on council.

237
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:55,040
And if you want to of course save some time you can copy the current code from get help.

238
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,860
Just to do it now whenever you get canceled.

239
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:03,280
You're going to get some data back and then the next one is the cons on error.

240
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,440
All right.

241
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,710
Open close.

242
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:13,530
And of course you get some errors back right now of course we need to set some other marbles.

243
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,090
So let's Envy's So we know that EMV it's environment.

244
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,630
So in this case we use the sandbox.

245
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,760
So we're going to use the sandbox which is the testing.

246
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,210
Right.

247
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,040
OK.

248
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:33,930
Then we need the currency equals and then you as d capital you as D you can use whatever currency you

249
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,460
wish.

250
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,150
All right.

251
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,540
And then the total so I'm going to say let's let equals.

252
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,460
Total right equals.

253
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,650
And remember that we are passing this as props.

254
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,500
Right.

255
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,140
So it's going to be this that perhaps.

256
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,970
And then to pay.

257
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,330
Right.

258
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,450
That is it.

259
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,550
So of course at least we should be getting something at least right here.

260
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,950
At least he would pay pal.

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,420
Right.

262
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,380
That that means that we get no errors.

263
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,730
Of course we need to import the Express button.

264
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:16,610
So import and then pay pal just like this express and then DTN right.

265
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,150
Okay.

266
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,410
Yeah everything's good.

267
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:27,510
And then of course from and re-act pay pal express check out now inside Pay-Pal you get different types

268
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,550
of connectors.

269
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,800
Now in this case we just get a button and that button will open a new window so we can make the transaction.

270
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:39,930
But you have different ways of creating a Pay-Pal know environment to create the purchase.

271
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,630
And of course everything is on the documentation of people.

272
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,690
It's pretty well documented.

273
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,500
All right.

274
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,030
But they are all the same thing.

275
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,980
After you set it up right here the connector and everything else they will give you just three different

276
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,770
you know final things.

277
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,190
And this is what we care because when we get the data back from PayPal we will have a lot of information

278
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,890
and then we will need to go to our server side and we will need to store that transaction in a different

279
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,240
place and we need to update the user account saying that the transaction was done.

280
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,110
Or maybe adding the items to the history of purchases and we can begin to do that after we connect to

281
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,980
Paypal.

282
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,040
But that's OK.

283
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,260
First we need to do this.

284
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,160
So after that total remember that we need that token.

285
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,760
So I'm going to say Konst client equals an array.

286
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,110
I'm sorry an object.

287
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,200
So we get a sandbox account sand box account and then of course we get the production of course we're

288
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,200
not going to use production.

289
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,010
We're not going to go to production on this one.

290
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,590
All right.

291
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,300
So the token if you remember it's right here the top.

292
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:53,940
So I'm going to copy the token I'm going to go to pay Paul Sand Box and paste it down there and of course

293
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,520
I did this in the past and the production there are pretty much the same.

294
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:06,530
And you just if you're working maybe in a different environment than react this would be really simple

295
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,220
it just passed the data to the HD mail they're going to provide you.

296
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,470
You can check this on the documentation you just pass the token.

297
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,480
And that's it it's going to it's going work.

298
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,600
It's just like including on a script at the top and that is it.

299
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,180
You know that's the normal way with just simple H.T. mail not with a single page application that you

300
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,550
put the script to of paper at the top.

301
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,710
You put the h d m l and inside you pass the token and that is it and it's going to go in works really

302
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,930
really good.

303
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,590
OK.

304
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,500
So what do we do now.

305
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,290
We need to create the button.

306
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:37,950
OK.

307
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:47,880
So going to go here and say OK I want to bring that Pay-Pal express button just like this opening close.

308
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,900
Now of course we need to pass a lot of information.

309
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,640
So if I ever load the application you know we get this PayPal button.

310
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
So at least we are getting it really actually and we can change it of course.

311
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,280
So we need to pass a lot of props to this people.

312
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,530
So first is the environment whether we're using production or some box.

313
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,020
Well we're going to use sandbox right.

314
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,370
The client the client is going to be equal to the client.

315
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,910
Same thing here.

316
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:17,850
All right.

317
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,300
Then koma.

318
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,850
Sorry going to ave Propp and we need to pass the currency so currency is going to be equal to currency.

319
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,160
Remember we are using it right here right.

320
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,430
What else.

321
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,770
We need the total So total it's equal to total and all this.

322
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:43,200
Of course this prompts are the ones that people express buy and will accept to make the transaction

323
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,000
a go at the bottom.

324
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,050
We get an on error.

325
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,020
So whenever we get an error we're going to run a function and that function of course has a callback

326
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,960
in some data.

327
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,680
So we pass the on error we did right here at the top.

328
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,290
So I got to say on error then we have the on success.

329
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,390
So unsuccess equals to the same unsuccess we have right here.

330
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,830
So on success.

331
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,100
All right then we get the uncancel so uncancel open and the council.

332
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,710
Okay.

333
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,520
And then of course this Bunin it's really really ugly.

334
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,700
So they give us different layouts.

335
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,640
And again you can check in on the documentation of PayPal.

336
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,330
So we're going to go to style and whenever you go to style we can pass up you know CSSA styling.

337
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,440
We can do that.

338
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,830
What they give you give us is different properties.

339
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,590
They give us a size and we can choose between large medium and small.

340
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,540
So we're going to use large that coma we can select the color.

341
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,320
And again they give you three or four options.

342
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,980
So I'm going to choose blue because I like color.

343
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,970
Then they give you a shape and again you have two or three options.

344
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:05,930
So I got to use recked coma and you know the label and the label is going to say check out something

345
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,540
like that.

346
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:14,490
Whenever I'm going to save it and if it reloads you know we get a much Pay-Pal check out you're going

347
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,930
to get a much better button right.

348
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,380
Much much nicer.

349
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,120
OK.

350
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,360
So if we actually do the purchase nothing is going to happen.

351
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,060
So we're going to go at the top so we can we can actually see it.

352
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,090
So I'm going to go right here and say console log open it close.

353
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,920
And if we do the payment of course if we cancel the payment it's going to come out on a can of a all

354
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,730
to it.

355
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,720
So we don't want to do is want to convert to a string.

356
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,240
So we can read it a little bit better.

357
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,070
So I'm going to do.

358
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,690
Jason stringin FY just like this opening closed.

359
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,430
And I'm going to just inspect the payment.

360
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,900
Same thing on the other ones.

361
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,600
I'm going to get the data and I'm going to get the error actually our That error.

362
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,770
So at least we can see it on the console and see what is going on after we do something right here.

363
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,350
So I'm going to save it and let's test it.

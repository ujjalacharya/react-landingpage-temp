1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,790
OK so now we're going to create the carts Ryan.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,340
OK.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,790
Now again if you're asking yourself dude can we do this on the server.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,680
Well yes you totally can.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,270
That is the one of the benefits of you know creating your own server.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,020
You can go to the routes and do whatever logic you want to do.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:24,700
Sometimes that it's not possible sometimes someone will hire you to create the application or the web

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,120
page or whatever it is that you want you're you're getting hired to do and they will tell you.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,510
OK.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,920
So I have a server guy.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,720
So you need to work with him.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,420
All right.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,610
So that is a problem because if you get a crazy idea or you have a crazy idea or you know maybe an idea

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,560
of doing something you can not just really go to the server and touch it yourself.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:52,990
You need to send the mail to the guy and say Dude I need this and maybe a is going to pass maybe a week

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:01:00,220
maybe a month or maybe more until they give you just this line of code instead of a route.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,850
So yeah this is one of the benefits of what we're creating yourself.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,680
Creating server yourself.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,760
Most of the times you're going to work the other way you're going to do the front end and someone else

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,170
is going to do the backend.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,640
That's the way it works.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,310
So this would be the best the best approach because you have pretty much the whole control.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,230
This one is just returning something very simple.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,350
So you do all the logic right here.

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,910
Right.

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,350
OK.

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,460
So let's create the cart.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,460
So right then so far we don't have anything.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,190
And later are we going to use this then.

30
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,720
Right now we're going to leave it empty but begin to do something else much much later.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,390
First we need at least some cartes.

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,590
So I'm going to create a really usable component because we might be using it later.

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:54,700
So I'm going to create a new folder inside tells that cause user just like this user and right here

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,420
are going to create a new component called I don't know product.

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,660
BLOCK Yeah.

36
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,280
Why not.

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,210
Product block.

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,540
So it's a re-act react stimulus component.

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,090
All right.

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,140
So user product and then block.

41
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,150
Right.

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,580
So this one just going to say block.

43
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,650
So of course we need to do some something here.

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,580
We need to import at least this.

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,480
So it's going to be use our product.

46
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:33,950
Block from that that forward slash you tels for Slash user for Slash and then product block.

47
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,720
All right.

48
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,240
Now before we can include the component we need to do some more lay out right here.

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,990
First we need to title Ryan pretty simple.

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:51,240
So where we get card going to say H1 and then my cart cart just like this.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,420
And then of course I'm going to rub everything inside of a depth.

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:04,760
So class name of user underscore carked and I'm going to include all the cards right here top so open

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,800
and close.

54
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,070
Now we need to pass some props right here.

55
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,900
First is the products so I'm going to say products and what you can do.

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,350
You can just pass the card detail with all the products or you can pass the user pass a user because

57
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,720
we might be using more things later.

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,180
So I'm going to pass whatever I get inside that this that prompts that user and instead of here we get

59
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,010
the card details.

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,750
Well again if we might we might be using this later.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,520
So I'm going to name this component that all the blocks right here are from the cart.

62
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,930
Maybe we're going to use it later.

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,230
So of course whenever we click an item we need the ability to remove the item so I'm going to say remove

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,000
item and of course we're going to catch the I.D..

65
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,850
So going to see I.D. and then we will run a function.

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:02,480
So does that remove from cart that we didn't have this function right here on our component.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,260
And we don't have it on the server.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,480
We don't have a router for deleting card items.

69
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,680
Of course we can it created much later.

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,380
Right.

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,250
So let's go to user product block.

72
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,950
Now we're going to get it.

73
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,920
We're going to get the products type and remove item.

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,960
So instead of doing prompts right here I could use some destructuring and say that I just want to get

75
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,630
the products I just want to get the removed item and I'm going to keep the time because we are not going

76
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,820
to use it from here just now later if we do use it.

77
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,680
We know that we have a type.

78
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,720
So we can include it maybe later.

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,470
All right.

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,240
So the first thing is catching whatever we get inside products card detail and show it on screen.

81
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,810
So I'm going to go here and say render items it's a function.

82
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,250
So I'm going to create a function.

83
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,570
So it's Konst name of the function.

84
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,020
Then of course we run something and we want to return some GSX.

85
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,530
Right.

86
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,130
OK.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,980
So instead of here we need to make sure that we have about detail so I'm going to answer that products

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,800
and I got to say if we do cart cart with T and then Details.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,330
Details then we want to do something if not again which is return NULL.

90
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,610
Pretty basic.

91
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,080
Now if we do have card details when it enter and I want to loop it because we might have many or maybe

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,900
just one.

93
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,730
So it's going to be we're going to catch the products just like this and then we will return GSX again

94
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:45,430
now I'm going to get just a div with your class name and this the class to me is going to be user underscore

95
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,170
product underscore and then Block.

96
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,660
And then of course we need to add a key as a key.

97
00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:00,610
I'm going to use the product actually it's Singler product just like this and then dot underscore ID.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,690
So we should be getting at least three when they're reloader again.

99
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,120
Three maybe we are not getting it.

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,920
Just let me double check why products products card detail leave its detail.

101
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm just flipping a coin right here.

102
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,230
OK I was right.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,830
So now we get three card because you know three items because we have three card.

104
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,260
And now let me just double check something right here.

105
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,280
It's on this one I forgot to change his card instead of card items item is card items.

106
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,570
So I'm going to make it right because we might have many

107
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,610
everything still works.

108
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,620
So I'm going to go back to punt block.

109
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,220
Now on this block you'll have several items like the image the name the quantity the price and then

110
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,130
the button to remove.

111
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,720
So on the on each item I'm going to create a container for this.

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,140
So class name and item.

113
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,620
Now the first thing it's the image.

114
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:13,830
So Dave opening close and I'm going to add a class name opening close and then this one it's going to

115
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,910
be image.

116
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,410
Now image of course has a style of background.

117
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:26,140
So let me close this so we can see the whole route style opening close background just seems always.

118
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,010
You are l.

119
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,750
We open it close and we could say no repeat.

120
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,370
Why not.

121
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,690
No.

122
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,500
Repeat.

123
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
All right.

124
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,260
So just like before this image you know the array of images might be empty.

125
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:47,930
So we need a function or something that decides if we're going to see the first image on the array or

126
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:57,990
an image not available so render card can be card or maybe cart image makes more sense.

127
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:04,450
Card image and of course is a function AAPS a munged function or ago.

128
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,610
Now if you're maybe you're asking yourself dude we could use this in the past shouldn't we use as a

129
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,680
reusable component.

130
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,940
Yeah you should just get to do it this way just here again.

131
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,310
But I'm using a reusable component would be a good idea.

132
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:31,040
So Alce and of course if we get the images that length and you can go if you wish to the component and

133
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,630
copy the same logic.

134
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:39,260
It's pretty much the same snippet so return images.

135
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:48,110
We return the first position then the u r l and of course if we if we don't have it return dot for Slash

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,020
images for Slash and then we get the image just not available.

137
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,130
There we go.

138
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm going to copy the name because remember I made a mistake with the name.

139
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:05,300
So I'm going to copy all that close it and return images not a baseball.

140
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,720
All right.

141
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,740
Looks good.

142
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,600
So that's what happens.

143
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,290
OK.

144
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,390
We get an error.

145
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,440
So length of undefined.

146
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,100
So let me just double check why should be ok.

147
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,800
Images of course you're not passing the images.

148
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,560
So it's product dot images.

149
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,910
Let's see if we get images at least.

150
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,730
Got we get something we are not getting the image.

151
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,010
Let me see why declasse image.

152
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,410
All right.

153
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,120
So it was very very dumb.

154
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,600
I forgot to close.

155
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,030
Right here I'm making the call to a function.

156
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,270
And of course I need to close it.

157
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,660
And what I need to do I need to close this.

158
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,330
So this was my mistake.

159
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,750
It was kinda weird Of course not attaching the style property and reload again so we can wait for the

160
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,320
server.

161
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,960
We can get it.

162
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,920
We get that sorry.

163
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,450
It's not available and everything else.

164
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,570
Of course we're going to attach more things to the right.

165
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,390
So this one is going to be pushed to the left.

166
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,810
All right.

167
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,120
Let's get to let's go back over this.

168
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,360
So we need to create more items.

169
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,970
This one is are going to be a little bit easy for us right now.

170
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:30,960
We need to act as the product name so ate it for then product the name and what we will be attaching

171
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,250
is the product name.

172
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,960
So I'm going to say product that name I'm sorry the brand product brand name and then of course the

173
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,610
product name.

174
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:46,650
So opening close and product that name lets you forget.

175
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,080
All right.

176
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,330
So we get it.

177
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,010
Next it's going to be the quantity I don't want to retype all of this.

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm going to copy and paste and say quantity.

179
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,170
All right.

180
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,740
So again we remember that we attached this property quantity.

181
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,940
So we just get it right.

182
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,430
So on the

183
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,760
or it's going to delete does.

184
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,500
Let's see if we get it.

185
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,600
Quantity 2 rocket mental math.

186
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:22,960
OK.

187
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,390
It's reloading without my change.

188
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,460
That is good.

189
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,110
So.

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,550
All right.

191
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,250
So we are done with the quantity.

192
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,080
What else.

193
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,240
We have the price.

194
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,370
So I'm going to delete this one more and this one is going to be the prize.

195
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,570
I know this is boring.

196
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,690
We are almost done.

197
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,760
So I'm going to say price and I'm going to do.

198
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,210
I'm going to do the next one which is actually the Bunin.

199
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,010
So this one will be a little bit special.

200
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,550
I'm going to attached a class of BDM and I'm going to remove this one I'm going to say price right here

201
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,500
horse and I'm going to put the dollar sign right here or whatever currency.

202
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,710
So Def open it close.

203
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,760
And this is going to be the Remove button.

204
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,270
So class name and then cart underscore remove underscore.

205
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,080
And now we need to attach a non-collector to this because whenever we click that we want to trigger

206
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,320
the function that we are passing this prompts this one remember remove item.

207
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,830
All right.

208
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,630
So whenever we click it and I'm going to do it here we are going to trigger a function called remove

209
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:36,120
item and remember that we are doing the structuring so we don't need to do props.

210
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,370
Remove item we are already kind of doing this now we need to tell this function which is DJT that we

211
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,410
want to delete if we go here we are passing an ID.

212
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,420
So we need to pass it.

213
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:57,350
So it's product dot underscore ID and right here we're going to say remove or something like that.

214
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,950
All right.

215
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,070
OK let's see what we get.

216
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,550
Now it's not that nice could be much much better.

217
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,430
Like it's old for the styles we get.

218
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,060
We are not going to do a lot of styles.

219
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,420
It's a pretty simple layout.

220
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,230
So now there are a couple things we need to do.

221
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,590
First we need to create a kind of a function or something that loops all the items we get right here

222
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:31,500
and we get a total amount you know one half five times three of course than 400 And then one hundred

223
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,160
times two.

224
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,350
And then we sum everything and we show the total amount of what the user needs to pay.

225
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,950
And of course later we're going to add the ability to remove and then we're going to go to Pay-Pal right.

226
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,420
OK.

227
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,640
So let's go let's go to the next one and start doing the same.

228
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,620
And then we move.

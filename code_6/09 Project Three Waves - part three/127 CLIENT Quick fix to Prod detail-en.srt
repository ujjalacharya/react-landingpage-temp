1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,720
All right before we move on to the next section I wanted to add a quick fix.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,890
If I go to buy a product and of course right now we get the correct ID and this idea accessed if I change

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,800
something on the ID.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,380
This ID doesn't exist anymore.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,200
So if we go we are get we are going to get stuck inside of loading because never get a response back

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,060
or a valid response.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,490
So we get products.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,150
All right.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,600
So what we can do.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,240
You can handle this here.

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,010
So if when then you get a response.

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,290
We are not going to really use a response.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,270
What you can do is just evaluate if you're not getting something inside products.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:49,100
So if prop's best actually does that prompts this that for up prop's dot product that detail exists.

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,300
We can do something but if it doesn't exist you know if it's empty then of course you want to do something

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,860
here.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,580
So cancell lock you know no article found and you can show this on the on the actual component.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,430
You can choose what to do here.

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,060
So for us I'm going to reload and no article found.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,830
If you go to a valid one you're going to go to View product.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,460
We are not getting this twice.

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,660
Of course I reload and we don't get it twice right.

23
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,310
So again what you can do here.

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,830
You can read direct back to home.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,420
You can completely do that.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,870
So since we are inside of a main route what you can do is it's direct from re-act right you can direct

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,360
or send the user back to not found.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,410
The problem is that we don't have a not found out right now.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,110
Right.

30
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:52,010
So we can to this the props that history that push and begin going to send the user back to home.

31
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,830
So back to home

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,850
of course right now works.

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,200
If I do something else not really happening and we go back to home in real life you should or show a

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,450
message right here instead of this component saying do this web page.

35
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,430
This article is not on the database anymore.

36
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,670
Maybe you want to you know tried to get related products that maybe not related but some other products

37
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,340
whenever.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,270
Is that you want to show or you can kick the user back to not found or go to home.

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,020
Depends on your application of course.

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,850
I just wanted to add this is pretty obvious but I just wanted to add it.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,470
All right.

42
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,080
So now let's go to the Add to Cart.

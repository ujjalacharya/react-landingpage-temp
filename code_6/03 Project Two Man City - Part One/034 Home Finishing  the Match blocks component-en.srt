1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,720
So finally let's create the blocks right here.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:11,030
So I'm going to go two blocks and on this function we do loop you know the all the list of matches we

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,280
get from the server.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,840
Let me close the log.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,590
And of course return a block.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,370
So in this case just going to do this.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,510
We don't need so and show matches.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,700
We are receiving this the state that matches.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,660
So I'm going to say mattress.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,960
OK.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,730
So if we do have matches we're going to go and do something if not we get a return.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,460
No we didn't this many many times before.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,530
So I'm going to access matches I can and do a map.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,390
And of course on each iteration I will return some GSX.

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,160
And again Notice I'm using parenthesis.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,910
OK.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,530
So the map will return a match.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:54,750
So on each match we will return a div with a class name of item class name item.

19
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:01,510
And inside I will return a div with a class name of wrap her or something like that.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,020
I believe proper Yes.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,990
Now if we stop for a second and we think about this this block this one we have right here we could

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,140
use a block like this in different components maybe in different places so we can make sense that this

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,190
could be reusable component.

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,490
And that's what we can do.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,330
I'm going to go to you.

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:31,670
I could create a new file that calls matches underscore block that yes and it's going to be just a single

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,670
block not the whole blocks.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,540
OK.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,250
So inside Majerus block this is going to be a re-act stateless components.

30
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,840
And I'm going to change name to matches matches and then block Breguet.

31
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,870
So right now we are not going to you know return anything just block.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,910
So inside of block we need to of course import this reusable component called match's block.

33
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:09,710
So import matches matches and then block from the data for Slashdot that force Lesch you for Slash and

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,550
matches.

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,620
BLOCK So now I'm going to go right here.

36
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,390
I'm going to make a reference to this div because right now we just have a div and I'm going to be passing

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:27,410
the match on each iteration so I'm going to go right here at the bottom and say of course match equals

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,350
match match equals match.

39
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,800
So now the match just blog will be receiving a prob with the match.

40
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,940
If we will know the application.

41
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,400
We get block Block block blocked six blocks.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,140
All right.

43
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:51,210
So inside Majerus block we're going to go right here and if we do console log just like this and I can

44
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,050
select the props we are getting.

45
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,780
And of course we are Depass to probs do the console.

46
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,350
It's a little bit low con. We get an object with a match and then the object.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,200
So what I can do I can use some a little bit of destructuring and I can do OK with the match Orion and

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,270
when it's once it's loaded.

49
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:22,020
Of course I need to do cons lock match when it's loaded instead of giving me match with an object inside

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,180
it.

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,050
With all the information we just get the information.

52
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:31,470
So now I can run I can return this component just making a reference to match and the name or match

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,460
and the ID and everything else.

54
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm going to go here.

55
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,530
And now what we need to do we need to start building all the you know the kind of the front end of this.

56
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:50,390
So class name and the class name the wrapper of this is match underscore block that is it.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,920
Now if we take a look at the original we have a date and then we have the Block 1 and then the block

58
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,680
to the top and the one to the bottom.

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,530
So OK.

60
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,920
So I've removed it.

61
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,770
So on the top we will have a div with the date.

62
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,400
This one contains a name a class name of match and then date date.

63
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,290
And instead of the date we will of course return match that date.

64
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,790
Now sometimes if I go to the server and go to matches we have a property called the date right here

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,590
date but we have one that it's going to be called Match final.

66
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,430
Now sometimes the match of course didn't start because it can happen in the future.

67
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,690
That didn't play the game or writing the game didn't start.

68
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,320
So if it's just final No we will display a message of match not played yet or something like that.

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,670
And of course the match was played which is we have final Yes we will just show the date.

70
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,410
That makes sense.

71
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,540
So I'm going to go right here and first thing going to say OK you match that final final.

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:06,030
It's true we will output match that date if we're not going to return something else and I'm going to

73
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,500
close this for now and I'm going to be returning match.

74
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,780
Not played yet.

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,740
Cohen is pace and I will attach the match dates and you know when this is going to be played.

76
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,020
Match date and all the games we have.

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,190
They are pretty much in the past so they were all over the place.

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,750
So we get to date forgive get going to Close's So now what do we need to do.

79
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,540
We need to start with a rapper.

80
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,520
With the first block and the second block.

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,230
All right.

82
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:49,100
So I'm going to go right here and say Dave opening close so we get the class name of match match and

83
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,990
then wrap her match.

84
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,370
There we go.

85
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:53,990
OK.

86
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,800
So we have a top and a bottom.

87
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,800
So for each we have a.

88
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,740
So day of class name I know that is the boring part.

89
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,160
And Heino I know.

90
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,160
So then match top.

91
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,260
Now if we take a look in the left we have something in the right.

92
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,860
We have a different block.

93
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,810
So we do have a div with match left and right.

94
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,700
So class name is going to be left and the other one is going to be you guessed it right.

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,080
OK.

96
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,440
So in the left we have something in in the right.

97
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,680
We have something else now in the left.

98
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,440
We have a Nikon which is the icon of the team and the Manchester City you know the name of the team.

99
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,940
So I'm going to go and say Dave I'm sorry with the class name and this one is going to be called I can

100
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,600
if I check the database on each.

101
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Each match we have the local teen thumbnail which is the name of the thumbnail inside of the public

102
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,770
images and team icons.

103
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,160
We're not fetching the images from the server.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,580
And of course on the other one the local sart local thumbnail and we have the a way thumbnail which

105
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:12,410
is going to be Manchester City for local or for a way you know while we have only have Manchester City

106
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,900
always have much history.

107
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's get.

108
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,690
So I'm going to call this an inside of the icon I'm sorry upside of the icon.

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm going to set the style and I'm going to be passing the background image so background just like

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,970
this.

111
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,230
Open it close we'll use templates strengths.

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,040
Right.

113
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:42,410
So it's your L opening close and the location it's images for Slash team icons forward slash and then

114
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:49,970
of course we pass the local thumbnail because the first one is always local so open and close.

115
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,970
We do match DOD local C T H and B.

116
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,590
Right.

117
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,110
And then it's always the PMG so that PNB and that is that if I save it in theory we should be getting

118
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,300
at least something and we do.

119
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,340
Let's get what else.

120
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,450
Then we have the team name.

121
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,240
So we're going to go at the bottom open close Dave with a class name and a class name for this.

122
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,570
It's team name make sense team name and the only thing we do it's for the local.

123
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,410
So we do match local.

124
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:33,270
So instead of top this could be local match local and then match away something like that and I'm going

125
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,830
Tuesday of course it's match local and we get the name right.

126
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,540
Manchester City Liverpool Burgert.

127
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,740
So now we need to put you know the right so inside of the right.

128
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,730
If you notice maybe this one if the result is not defined We're going to put this dash and that could

129
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,510
happen.

130
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,760
So we're going to say if match that final final which means that the you know the game didn't start

131
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,510
we're going to put the match which is true.

132
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,750
We're going to put match and result and then local and this result.

133
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:19,690
It's of course on the database resoled local right here if not of course we're going to put that cash.

134
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,070
So open close dash.

135
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,810
All right.

136
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,990
So let's check it out.

137
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,480
So we have a dash and the local resoled.

138
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,560
All right of course they made a mistake here.

139
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,320
Maybe the date is wrong.

140
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,510
But that's good.

141
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,210
What else we need to put away.

142
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,330
So the weight instead of match top is going to be match bottom makes sense.

143
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:51,640
You know the opposite class name and then match and then but we are almost done guys and we have pretty

144
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,530
much the same thing.

145
00:09:53,530 --> 00:10:00,490
So I'm going to copy and paste the only difference is that now instead of local is going to be a way

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,990
right and they match local no match way and rissoles local No resoled way.

147
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,410
All right.

148
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,400
That is it.

149
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,340
Got to reload it and we can't get it.

150
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,070
That is good.

151
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,040
Very good.

152
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,780
Now if I go to the final one below the application I scroll down.

153
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,790
We have the you know the sliding effect.

154
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,010
So that's the last thing we're going to be adding because this is ready.

155
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,470
OK.

156
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,150
So I'm going to go back to blog and we will use Riak reveal.

157
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,870
You know it's a very simple transition.

158
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,430
We are not used re-act move while doing all that code just to do that makes no sense.

159
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:47,920
So I'm going to bring the slide from re-act reveal import and remember we've already installed this

160
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,390
on a package that Jason re-act reveal we do have it right here.

161
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,680
All right.

162
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:04,790
So import slide from re-act reveal react reveal and we bring a slide.

163
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,780
Real simple.

164
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,080
And inside of slide instead of returning this item we will return we will return a slide right and make

165
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,630
sense and go to the bottom close and slide.

166
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,730
All right.

167
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,540
That is it.

168
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,150
So now of course we want to slide it from the bottom.

169
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,800
So you say bottom just like this.

170
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:33,460
And since we are looping and returning an element we need to give a key so key opening close match dot

171
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,690
ID.

172
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,240
And if you reload and scroll down same result very good.

173
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,370
And of course this one is link you know the tag everything.

174
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,700
So everything looks nice.

175
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,520
So the next section is going to be the.

176
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,800
This animation going to do a more animation and then we're going to go back to the database to enter

177
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,690
you know enter they are the user e-mail to the e-mail.

178
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,400
The mailing list or something like that to win a jersey.

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,220
And after we finish the home we're going to start building the back.

180
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,250
And right we can do authentication and everything else.

181
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,310
So if you're not interesting interested on this on this component and this component you just can go

182
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,550
move forward get the code from Get have or actually get it from the last section where we do this.

183
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm going to give you that code and now I'm going to give you the code for this one and you can just

184
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,680
you know put it on your computer do your own or NPM install and get it from this point and you start

185
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,670
watching the authentication process with firebase and everything else you can totally totally do that.

186
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,630
No problem.

187
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,720
But this is done.

188
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,090
This section is done.

189
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,240
So let's going to move forward and go to meet the players at home.

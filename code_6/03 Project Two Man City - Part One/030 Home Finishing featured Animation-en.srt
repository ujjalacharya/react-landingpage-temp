1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,280
OK so let's animate the texts.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,460
So for the application we can see that we have four times of types of animations.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,560
We have the number then the first text then the second text and then the player.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,990
So this is what we're going to be doing.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,610
And now it's going to be much much easier because we know how this works.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,530
So on the other one is going to be a piece of cake.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,120
Right.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,830
So we have a component.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,860
We do have a component to host all this animations and we have it inside text of course we have and

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,240
it nothing right here.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,160
So we're going to need a real class based component Riak RACC.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,300
And this could be a stateless component.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,730
Yeah it could be a stateless component doesn't matter.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,700
You can do that which is going to create a class right now.

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,470
So first we need to import all the animated related stuff the dependencies for animations we have in

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,190
stripes.

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,780
So I'm going to copy go to text and paste it.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,570
All right.

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,280
So of course scene within featured.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:08,490
We need to render the text below Strypes so import than text from that for Slash and then text right.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,530
And of course we need to make a reference right here text.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,570
So I'm going to go back to text now inside text.

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,560
We need to render a wrapper.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,140
Where are we going to be containing all of this animation.

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:31,440
So the class name for this will be class name and then featured and then text and inside of here we

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,200
will render four types of Funimation's so I will run four different functions.

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,880
So the first one is going to be called this animate.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,880
I don't know first why not animate and then first which is going to be the number not going to do number.

29
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,400
So made number first is the actual text first to get made number right.

30
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,220
So I'm going to copy the name of the function I'm going to go right here and just create a function

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,900
rhyme.

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,480
We just run a function.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,320
Now this function will return some GSX.

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,010
So we need to use parenthesis instead of square brackets.

35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,320
What we return is going to be that animate tack we were using previously and what we do we return a

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,780
function with the actual.

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,770
Just like with it before the Notkin explain it again.

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,760
You know go back to the previous section.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,730
So we were trying to function in this case open it close and we return some function.

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,730
Now from this one we will get all the props like opacity or rotate and background and everything like

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,520
everything else.

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,150
But we're going to do it later.

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,990
Of course we need to return some sex so opening closed.

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,740
And I will be returning just a dip in this case.

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:53,430
I want a class name for featured And then number that's the class of this one.

46
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,290
And of course we need to attach the styles with all the animations and everything else.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,610
So in this case I'm going to say style Sorry style equals and leave it empty.

48
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,540
We don't have the properties so far and then are going to say just three I'm going to go back.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,800
And of course cannot the structure undefined because we are not really passing anything that's good.

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,370
Now of course we need to pass all the properties to the animate tack.

51
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,400
So I'm going to say this one show it's true.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,720
We want to show it.

53
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,720
So true.

54
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,620
And then close it and then we have a start and then enter.

55
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,450
So I'm going to say start equals something.

56
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,110
Now we will do two things.

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,200
We will add capacity and rotation.

58
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:40,580
So opacity equals zero then a coma and then rotate equals zero.

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,770
So the starting point point it's zero.

60
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,230
Then of course when it enters We want to do animations.

61
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,590
So opacity again we change it to 1.

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,590
And remember the square brackets.

63
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:00,070
Then what we want to do we want to rotate and we want to rotate 360 degrees for rotation.

64
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,840
And then of course we always need to add the timing and note is that right now it's working.

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:15,030
So timing that timing we have to ration in this case I'm not going to add a delay just duration just

66
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,650
like this.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,320
And it's going to take one second and then the easing the ease we will use the one at the top which

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,310
is the same one than the other one is pulling out.

69
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,840
Right.

70
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,110
So now we are using opacity and rotation.

71
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,180
So I'm going to copy capacity pass it to the function and then rotate.

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,250
And then again pass it to the function.

73
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,240
Now of course inside styles we need to make a reference to this of Pasotti.

74
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,560
So we will say just opacity and the rotation it is a transform just like the other one.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,500
So Tran's form open close and we will use template strings.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,230
So again we will I will do a translation.

77
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:05,170
Real simple translate and open and close and it's going to be two 60 pixels coma 1 70 pixels.

78
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,780
Now there's no point of doing this.

79
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,860
This is the starting point where this number is going to be positioned pretty much that that is it.

80
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,340
And then of course we have the rotate on the closes and the rotation we do have a rotation value.

81
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:26,280
So rotate y opening close and we need to pass the property so open it close rotate and you know it is

82
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,500
done.

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,500
I'm going in a little bit fast right now.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,770
So the rotate degrees and we do get it.

85
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,730
No we get that animated number.

86
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,050
All right that's good.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,010
All right let's fix the problem with the font.

88
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm going to go to Google font and it's because we never include this inside of the project.

89
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,050
Sorry for that.

90
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,570
So Google and fonts.

91
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,070
So I know this is boring but you know part of the process.

92
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,580
Are they going to do rubato.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,010
And and.

94
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,460
OK.

95
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,250
And the other one is the same one than the other project the writers like this font.

96
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,430
I don't know why so rebozo customize than light medium and that's it.

97
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,440
We don't know the other ones.

98
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,510
So I'm going to copy Blinkx go to the index.

99
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,090
Pasted right here save it and if I go back while we do have all of that you know the number.

100
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,070
So now we need to create the first animation for the number for the search for the text the first text.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,670
So this is animation.

102
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,980
I'm going to go back to text.

103
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,320
We just need to do pretty much the same thing with different values instead of the animate number.

104
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm going to call it this animate.

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,730
And then first.

106
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,500
All right.

107
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,970
Just run the function.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,310
Now we don't have a function to go right here.

109
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,660
Animate first opening close and we will return some GSX.

110
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,400
Now the animation looks like this one so I'm going to copy and paste it.

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,900
Now if you can sell it.

112
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,750
Could we do just maybe a loop and loop some properties.

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,860
Well yeah you could be told it could.

114
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,190
You know I'm doing this way we did that with stripes.

115
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,800
All right.

116
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,120
So again we just need that number the first we return of course something different and different instead

117
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,090
of a number.

118
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,950
It's going to be needed first.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,180
Now we do have a past city and the transform We do have a translate but we don't have rotation so I'm

120
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,330
going to remove it.

121
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,150
And of course we're going to use different properties and instead of three we will say Lee.

122
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,250
All right.

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,580
So instead of rotate I'm going to rotate and I'm going to do it again rotate.

124
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,180
We will use the x and y axis so there's two values.

125
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,250
So X with some values and then of course why.

126
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,180
So I'm going to say why with some Ballis now the values for x which is the default are going to position

127
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,700
the number on this place.

128
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,530
If I put 0 they're going to go right here at the top.

129
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,420
But I need to put them right below the number so.

130
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:01,930
OK.

131
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:09,510
So I'm going to delete it and the numbers are 5 0 3 and have done this of course 5 0 3 and 450.

132
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,980
So now we need to animate the X and Y because they're going to go from here to here.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,640
You know this is the starting point.

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,320
And then again going to go and stop right here.

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,540
OK.

136
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,080
So the X are going to wrap everything in square brackets and I complete.

137
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,370
And it's going to be 2 7 3 2 7 3.

138
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,780
Again I totally already done the math and the y 450.

139
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,310
There's actually no need to use the Y we can use for 50 but we need to actually pass it right here.

140
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,390
So it's the same value.

141
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,280
So now we are using an X and Y and I'm going to change the duration instead of one second is going to

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,830
be 500 and same easing in other translation.

143
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm going to use template strings to use x and to use Y.

144
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:00,990
Right.

145
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,660
Of course we need to be adding pixels right here at the bottom at the end and then an opacity we need

146
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,150
to pass this property so x and y.

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,590
If I reload the application there we go.

148
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,020
We get it right.

149
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,940
So since this one was very simple let's do the other one the championship which is going to be pretty

150
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,080
much the same thing.

151
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,730
So same process going to create a function does that animate and then show.

152
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,570
I don't know.

153
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,750
Maybe animate second instead of show makes sense second.

154
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,680
All right.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,800
And we pretty much do the same thing before if you want to create a loop to do this.

156
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,560
You totally can you can manage everything through state.

157
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:56,930
So I'm going to copy this one from within the animate going to copy and I made a mistake right here

158
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,850
and to this one and put some penances.

159
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,410
All right.

160
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,300
So animate instead of like is going to be championships championships.

161
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,120
That's the first change.

162
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,330
Cham peenemnde chips.

163
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,190
Raggatt.

164
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,830
So they really are the champs they want the up to 18 title.

165
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,550
So they really are champions.

166
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,480
So instead of featured first featured second right and capacity and transform We will use pretty much

167
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,670
the same thing.

168
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,660
The only thing it's going to change right here are the values.

169
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,820
Everything else stays the same.

170
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,630
Now I'm going to go to X. It's going to be 5 0 3.

171
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,980
Same position on the X.

172
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,540
But to 7:3 same position on the X right.

173
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,570
This is good.

174
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,260
Now if you notice this when it's below league.

175
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,020
So now we need to change the y axis 2 5 8 6.

176
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,090
And then of course 5 8 6.

177
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,130
That doesn't change.

178
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,910
So we're going to reload the application our application and we are not getting it.

179
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,560
Let me see what I mean.

180
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:10,050
Of course of course get reloaded and we can get it.

181
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,270
Now the problem is that you know if we take a look at this one first comes leak and then comes comes

182
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,290
championship championships.

183
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,820
So we need to achieve this and we can do it through delay delay and timing right.

184
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:30,160
So I to go and say the lay open it close and you know not too much.

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,190
And if I reload it we get it right.

186
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,250
So we are almost done the only thing left is just a player and it's just an impasse in effect.

187
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,480
All right so let's add the player visible.

188
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,080
We just need to do an animation with the positive.

189
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:52,660
So this dot animate and then of course player open costs.

190
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,650
So a player is going to be a function that is going to be returning some assets at this point.

191
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,590
This should be really easy for you.

192
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,360
All right.

193
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,960
So any player will be returning something so I don't want to type all over again.

194
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,740
I'm going to copy paste.

195
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,420
So again show true and capacity.

196
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,620
We didn't need the x y so I'm going to delete the x y and just leave the opacity and the delay is going

197
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,570
to take you know.

198
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,910
This one shows at the end.

199
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,190
Sorry I'm a little bit sick.

200
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,080
So sometimes my throat.

201
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,870
Just so time delay.

202
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,660
Eight hundred.

203
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,470
Right here in my country right now in my country it's winter so everyone can get sick.

204
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,980
And that's really a bummer.

205
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:48,380
So feature player of course we need to change this and the style is just a pastie and other transform.

206
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm going to you know put the default positioning of the actual image so to 0 1 and that's the key.

207
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,940
We didn't have a word right here.

208
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:04,390
We have an image so we need the background image so we can put it right here.

209
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:13,310
So everything it's on resources and resources we do have this image feature player and it's too large.

210
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,230
Maybe we can trim and trim that down but does it matter right now.

211
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,030
So we're going to include it right here at the top.

212
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:28,620
So we say import featured and then player and this is something you will need to do in real life.

213
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,700
Sometimes the designer maybe you know maybe you don't.

214
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:40,430
Sometimes the designers or the people that will be creating the design for you to create right here

215
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:47,060
on the team version they will give you the images and sometimes the images are really big.

216
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:54,350
They are kind of a not very safe to to use on you know a loading environment because you're going to

217
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,230
be loading images from the web.

218
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,660
So you know if there are really heavy.

219
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,420
Right.

220
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,530
So let me.

221
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:01,970
There you go.

222
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,390
Feature player so they're really heavy.

223
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,740
So sometimes you will need to use some software maybe Photoshop or I don't know whatever software you

224
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,650
want to use to trim down the size.

225
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,690
This one the feature player.

226
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,070
It's one megabyte.

227
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,100
It's too much too much.

228
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,200
I'm sorry for that I forgot to trim that down.

229
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,070
But in real life if you go to production you need to trim it down.

230
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:24,810
All right.

231
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,070
So now we do have an image so I'm going to need to go right here the bunkroom at the bottom and pass

232
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,070
the Eurail of the image right.

233
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:41,630
It says background open it close and it's you are all open close and we just pass with templates strings.

234
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,010
Real simple.

235
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,370
The featured player and of course koma

236
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,950
and there we go you know we can get it.

237
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:59,180
This is my belief this is my mistake because I'm loading a component before the actual text after the

238
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,040
test.

239
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:06,200
So we got an e-mail number first and then second and then players.

240
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,360
This is my mistake.

241
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:14,350
The player should be loading first because he's going to go you know behind of all of this text.

242
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,310
Say if I reload it like go again.

243
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,230
There we go.

244
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,000
We can get it.

245
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,140
So we have the same animation.

246
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:31,110
So this is it you know this was not a lot of work a lot of this was you know copy paste but you know

247
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,100
this is the kind of complicated thing to understand and all.

248
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,070
Returning the function y at right here we don't need x y.

249
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,420
So why return after you do it one time.

250
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,670
It's pretty obvious right.

251
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,890
You can repeat this and create really complex animations.

252
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,920
And of course remember to always check the re-act move.

253
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,370
Now we will do more animations.

254
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,540
Not this one but we're going to do something like this and we're going to do this.

255
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:04,550
And then on the team I'm sorry the matches we will animate list with that.

256
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,470
No group right here no group.

257
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,330
We will use that one to animate this thing.

258
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,050
All right.

259
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,310
So let's go to the next one.

260
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm going to give you the code of course you can find the resource the code for this section and begin

261
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,200
to move forward and do the next one the matches.

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,780
And this one is going to get really interesting here because the matches they need a database they need

263
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,190
you know the name of the teams they need the logos they need the they.

264
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,750
How much how was the how the match.

265
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,030
Our team won or something like that you know we need that kind of information and that information comes

266
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,900
from the database.

267
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:49,230
And we don't have a database so we will need to create a database with firebase feet some information

268
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:56,700
and then you know do all the set up in our project to connect to the data to firebase to retrieve the

269
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,300
data.

270
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,800
All right.

271
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,390
So let's go to the next section and start of that.

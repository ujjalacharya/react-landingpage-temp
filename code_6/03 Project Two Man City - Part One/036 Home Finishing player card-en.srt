1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,600
All right so like we use book before we need for re-act reveal to tell us or to communicate to the cartes

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,570
component that you know this section was revealed and we need to trigger the animation if you remember

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,820
with React move.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,990
We have the state of show which is true or false.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,230
So pretty much when the animation starts all with the page loads that show under-react move is going

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,120
to be false.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,000
But when we reach here re-act reveal will change the state to true and the animation will trigger.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,300
That's the logic.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,090
So first I'm going to do this first.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:33,890
OK.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,280
I'm going to go right here and say import reveal right.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,800
We need to use re-act reveal right here reveal.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,990
And it's from.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,620
And react react.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,160
Dash reveal reveal.

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,210
Very good.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,210
Now I'm going to reveal from Briac reveal.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,760
So can I do this.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,220
All right.

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,860
And now what do we need to do.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,870
We need to wrap everything.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,240
No.

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,570
This whole section inside this re-act reveal.

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,350
So I'm going to go right here and say reveal open and close ups open and close.

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:17,030
They're going to copy child this cut zcode we're going to remove it and put it inside of re-act real.

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,160
If I select everything right click for my selection it's going to make it a little bit better.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,160
So now this reveal contains this on reveal property whenever this is happening we can trigger a function.

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:38,480
So I'm going to say on reveal just like this reveal equals to a function opening close and we will trigger

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,690
a different function you know kind of a callback.

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:51,960
So for now I'm going to say console log revealed so we can actually see it on the browser right here.

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,750
So let me go right here on the top and I'm going to go to cons. Now it is that we are not getting you

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,820
know this comes from blogs.

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,270
Maybe you can delete it later.

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,380
And if I scroll down as girl down there we go we get revealed.

35
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:10,200
Now the rebill appears whenever this part of the code you know the first part of the component rebuilds

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,170
to the screen.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,190
So in addition of Henri reveal we have a different property that calls for action.

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,240
So this fraction it's from zero to 1.

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,970
So we can pass to a fraction.

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,730
How much of this component should be revealed on the screen in order for the you know re-act reveal

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,420
to trigger that on rebill callback.

42
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,500
So in this case I'm going to use 0.7 of course all of this is on the documentation so I'm going to try

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,030
again.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:45,130
Going to go right here the top reload the application going to go below and you know it gave us the

45
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,450
bill pretty much after we have the whole component on the you are right on the screen.

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,680
So instead of doing a cons like what we will do will change the state.

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,080
So I got to say right now show equals false.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,200
So whenever the application state is start starts show it's equal to false and right here what we do

49
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,040
we change that.

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,780
This data set stayed open close and then show it's equal to true.

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,950
So now whenever we called the to the component that it's going to be ruling this animation we will pass

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,770
the state of show which is false.

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,310
But when we get on reveal we will get the true and the animation will we'll run.

54
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,890
Makes sense right.

55
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,180
Perfect sense.

56
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,520
So now we don't have a component to rule this.

57
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,870
We don't really have it.

58
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,830
We have the file but we don't have anything else so let's create that one are going to create a react

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,340
class based component.

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,790
And this one open mistake.

61
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,710
Our classmates component.

62
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,870
And this one will be called home cards something like that.

63
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,510
Now in-home carts we will use will be using different things.

64
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,190
For example the money made from re-act move and that the D-3 ease.

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:08,730
So just because I'm lazy I'm going to go to Strypes inside feature and copy from here shortcut.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,350
So easy pull out same thing and animate from re-act animate.

67
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,650
Now if you notice on the original we are using this thumbnail.

68
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,550
So we need to bring that player image.

69
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:30,390
So import and that player calls are to mehndi is a Argentinian player from the that for Slashdot that

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,660
for Slashdot or for Slash resources images just like this.

71
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,600
Then players for Slash and they believe it's the name of the player.

72
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,390
And then we got we get the image on this component for now this is good of course to create the animation.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,800
We will need a state.

74
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,620
So I'm going at it right here and this show and this is one way to do it.

75
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,110
So this is going to be this that props because this component will be receiving some props and are going

76
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,080
to say there's the props that show now right here.

77
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,890
I didn't change the name of the class.

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,750
Sorry for that.

79
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,720
For now I'm going to return you know card whatever.

80
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,000
So this component is going to get a props which show which is true or false.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,750
So this show will change to true or false.

82
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,520
And from misc No.

83
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,990
From meet the players we need to make a reference to this card.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,240
We didn't include it on this component so I'm going to go right here.

85
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:41,880
Import and home cards from that forward slash and then cards home cards the name of the component.

86
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,500
OK.

87
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,210
So now we are including this so we need to make a reference on the actual code.

88
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,030
So we're going to go and say home cards and then close it.

89
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,590
If you remember we are we need to pass this show property.

90
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:01,110
You know we need to pass this props and it's this that state that show initially will be false but when

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,190
it changes we'll be receiving a prompt change.

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,860
OK.

93
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,930
Let's get we are we are on the good track.

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,180
So now what we need to do we need to return the actual animation.

95
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,260
If I go right here we get just card.

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,030
So I'm going to go at the bottom and create a function this that show.

97
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,580
You could put this with whatever name doesn't matter.

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,920
And he made cartes Kratz no cards right.

99
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,120
So now we'll create a function that will loop through all the cards or maybe through loop three times

100
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:44,700
because we need three or four cards and it will you know render some some component some elements.

101
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:53,950
So I'm using again parenthesis not curly braces and what we'll do we will loop through this that state

102
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,490
that cartes.

103
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,480
Right.

104
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,820
So how many cards do we need.

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,450
Let's check the fine one.

106
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,830
We have one two three and four.

107
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,750
So what do we need to do.

108
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,860
We will need to create a state with carts right here with an array of elements with four different elements

109
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,780
with different properties so I will create just four because we need four cards.

110
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:24,620
Now the animation the only thing we need to animate is still left at the bottom right.

111
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,070
This one is to you know bottom zero bottom 20 bottom know 40 and then 60.

112
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,330
So that's what we need to do.

113
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:41,180
So just from start we need a property with Bonham and then a property with a left right.

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,220
So the bottom for the first one in are going to do this right now.

115
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,770
Point out the bottom for the first one is going to be 90.

116
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:56,200
The second one is going to be three on the left 300 are going at the other ones Bunim 60 and bottom

117
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,880
left 200 something for the other ones.

118
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,790
So bottom 30 and then 100.

119
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,670
And then bottom zero and this is the first the first one.

120
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,020
Bottom zero and left zero.

121
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,960
Now what you can do.

122
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,030
You can create a function maybe a loop and just change the numbers dynamically you know plus 30 or minus

123
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,560
30 or something like that doesn't matter.

124
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,780
This is just one way to do it.

125
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,940
So right now I'm going to do.

126
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,910
I'm going to loop the cards not.

127
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,140
Cards and generally the animation with the with this property.

128
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,470
We kind of already did this with the animate move with the react.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,020
So I'm going to enter this.

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:52,930
That state DOT carts just like this that map and this map will be returning just one card and the iteration

131
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,460
number.

132
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,370
And then of course we will run a function and return some GSX just like this.

133
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,510
All right.

134
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,040
Now this one will return an animate tag from from re-act move.

135
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,460
Animate opening close.

136
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,890
If you remember what we need to do is return a function.

137
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,570
So we open it close.

138
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,150
We will use some destructuring inside and then we will just returned the function with the actual elements

139
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,700
always do return open and close.

140
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,310
And this one will be just a def and we will come back to this later.

141
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm going to say just dip for now.

142
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,550
Now the animate going to go right here at the top.

143
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,630
The Man-Made it's using a left and a Bunim And of course since we are looping something we need to add

144
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,120
key.

145
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,490
So we add key with the iteration with the index.

146
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,340
Right.

147
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,920
If you remember we are using show.

148
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,770
So we use this that props that show.

149
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,080
And this that prompts that show let's get in now.

150
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,770
Think about it.

151
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,570
There's no two uses.

152
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,120
OK.

153
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,890
So there's the props that show very good.

154
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,540
So now I'm going to go to start equals and we need to pass a prop..

155
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,930
The first one is left starts at zero.

156
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,390
The next one it's but him and it starts at zero.

157
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:12,910
Right.

158
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,620
OK.

159
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,080
And then we have an enter and the Enter would be where are going to go.

160
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,350
On this one we do have a left.

161
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,750
We do have a button on the left one is going to be whatever we get from the state on each iteration.

162
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:36,020
So it's going to be card that left the other one is going to be card dot right.

163
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,300
Oh sorry bought them.

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,450
And then since this one is the one that it's going to be doing the animation we need to add the timing

165
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,110
property so timing.

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,820
All right.

167
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,040
So we will need to add to duration and duration.

168
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,070
Half a second.

169
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,930
And the ease it's going to be Pawley.

170
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,420
Let me find it right here.

171
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,340
East Point out forget.

172
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,900
We're almost done.

173
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,450
Now we need to pass the left just like this.

174
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,270
And the bottom because these are the properties we are using for this element and right here we need

175
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:19,830
to pass this style opening close and the need to use the position we are going to change this to position

176
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,250
absolute.

177
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:29,160
That's why we're using the top and left and bottom left and bottom and absolute and we're going to use

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:37,610
the left coma and then the bottom and then said I'm going to go to our application and we can get it

179
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,590
you know I'm going to reload it.

180
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,220
And there we go.

181
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,280
So OK let me go back.

182
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,460
Oh goodness.

183
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,030
All right.

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,340
So we started very low.

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,780
There we go again.

186
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,830
Girls girls girls grow and then you can see the transmission right here.

187
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,190
Of course we didn't have a card.

188
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,440
That's going to be the next step creating a component of reusable components where we can you know create

189
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,690
a player cart.

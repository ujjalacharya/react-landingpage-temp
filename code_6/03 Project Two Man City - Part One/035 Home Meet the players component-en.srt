1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,150
All right so let's create the media players section.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,780
So I'm going to go right here to our project and this of course is going to be one more component inside

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,390
home.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,640
So it kind of makes sense for me for going to go home and create a new folder and a directory called

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,890
I don't know meet the players or meet players.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,530
That makes sense right.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,560
So many players will have two different components which is the index and then we have two different

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,750
sections which is going over you know the main layout in the right and the main layout with the animation

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,910
in the left.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,280
So inside the player's index the genius and the other one will be called cartes.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,760
Now the cards we can have a meet to make a reusable component because the original figure and the final

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,810
one if I go to the team we get the you know the same cards we get from from from home.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,140
So we get to make sense again.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,180
For us to create a reusable component so we didn't have to repeat a lot of code.

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,810
All right.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,910
So from cartes for now I'm not going to do anything inside of the players.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,770
I need a re-act class based components.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,620
You're going to see why I'm using a class based component and this one is going to be called Meet the

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,730
or meet players.

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,880
Just to sum it up mid players and then meet players forget.

21
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,010
So if you notice in the background we have kind of a tiny PNB is a sprite.

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,850
So we're going to repeat it and create this background.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,960
And this of course is in resources and images right here resources images and I believe it was called

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,660
stripes.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,240
There we go.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
We have you know this.

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,650
So we're going to bring it so we can attach it to the background.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm going to go and say import the stripes stripes from that that for Slashdot for Slash one more time.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,820
And then of course resources for Slash images for Slash and store right.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,850
Yes.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
There we go.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,760
What else are we going to use tax right here the in the right.

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,050
We use the tax we've been using before that reusable component.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,570
So we need to import it as well because we're going to be using it import Takk from DOD for Slashdot

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,630
that forward slash you I.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,510
And then from the misc file.

37
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,880
Right.

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,430
Miscellaneous.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,460
Now we will have a state.

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,890
For now I'm going to leave it empty.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,210
Going to say state and then we're going to talk why we are using a stake right here.

42
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,990
Now on the return we're going to be returning for now just a class a container of course with the class

43
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,430
name of home meet players something like this.

44
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,050
All right.

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,980
Now this container has the background with the stripes.

46
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,960
So I need to pass the style and the background with the you know the image so background.

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,880
And then we use Collen template strings.

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,530
And I'm going to say that the background is going to be white by default and we're going to be using

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,110
that pride as well.

50
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,400
And I'm going to open and close and use that.

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,860
Tripes I believe I called the strypes stripes and of course by default it's repeat.

52
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,830
So we can generate dat and repeat the background.

53
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,900
If I put something inside of here me go back put something inside of here and save it.

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,930
Of course we're going to get something but first we need to go to the index of home and require and

55
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,740
import this meet players.

56
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:48,780
So we're going to go here in Port meet for years players from that forward slash meet players and since

57
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,530
we have an index there is no need to put in X than meet the players.

58
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,230
No standard stuff right here.

59
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,060
Nothing new.

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,750
And of course we get you know that line of code with the background Burguet.

61
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,620
OK.

62
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,300
So let's go back to meet the players.

63
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,390
I'm going to remove blocks because are not going to use it.

64
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,750
The source firebase you know a lot of components we don't really need right now mask goodbye and matches

65
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,200
goodbye.

66
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,990
I'm just going to leave to meet the players which is the index and then cartes.

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,640
All right.

68
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:25,170
So here we need to do a lot more going to do lead and create a dev with a class of container because

69
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,030
we need to center everything.

70
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,330
So it's container and inside of here are going to add one more wrapper.

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,160
So Dev because his obsession flexed flex and he's flex right here.

72
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,360
So class name opening close and this one this class KOLs home meet players we just know pretty much

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,220
the same thing in this.

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,790
I'm going to copy and paste and then wrapper.

75
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,690
So instead of here whenever the app loads.

76
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,210
Of course now we get nothing.

77
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,220
But now we're going to get something like this you know a default to sites in the left.

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,390
We'll have the animation in the right.

79
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,950
We'll have the you know the text.

80
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,490
So I'm going to create a container for the left and a container for the can you know the right so diff

81
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:19,380
opening close the class name of this one is going to be home card and then wrapper and right here we

82
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,280
can have the card that begin to be creating in a few minutes.

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,630
And then this one which is the right side.

84
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,750
Class name opening close home text and then wrapper.

85
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,270
All right.

86
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:40,810
And right here we're going to get the text real simple and if we reloaded we have cart and we have text

87
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,890
that is good.

88
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,200
Now inside of the home text wrapper we need to add the text the same component we have right here.

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,360
But of course with different properties.

90
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,820
So I'm going to add the first tack when I say dev opening close and I'm going to add a tack right here.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,730
The meat to it right.

92
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,890
There we go.

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,860
So instead of here we need to keep the put the wart meat.

94
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,350
This is the first tack.

95
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,170
So meat right.

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,410
Of course we need to be packed we need to pass some properties in order for this work.

97
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,540
If you remember is the background I'm going to close this so that we can see everything the background

98
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,840
and the background has does that blue color.

99
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:29,200
It's 0 1 7 7 3 1 0 1.

100
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,250
There we go.

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,560
Then the size I'm going to say its size and it's the font size.

102
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,880
So 100 pixels then we say color and we find the color of the you know of the text.

103
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:50,150
So once you have three one two three it's white and that one should be getting something at least.

104
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:57,520
Now we need to add additional CSX information so I'm going to use that and again you know concatenate

105
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,350
the styles with the props.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,870
If you remember this weekend it did this before.

107
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,600
So the display for this one.

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,620
This play will be in line and then block.

109
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,190
And I'm going to add a margin bottom of tiny pixels.

110
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,540
We need to do pretty much this on all the tacks right here.

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,190
All right so get we get meat.

112
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,060
Now the next one will be pretty much the same same idea than this.

113
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,700
So I'm going to copy this.

114
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm not going to copy this.

115
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:40,020
I'm going to go at the bottom and say Meet D and save it and we got the.

116
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,460
Then the players and players Oh sorry for that.

117
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,710
Meet the players.

118
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,530
And we get beat the players.

119
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,200
That's good.

120
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,960
Now again this is a lot of space.

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,780
So I'm going to go back I did this just to you know show you this.

122
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,170
But you know I see it in a lot of space just for you know two or three things so I don't really like

123
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,770
it just get to do this.

124
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,500
Sorry for this.

125
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm going to take one minute or less.

126
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,600
Almost done and then the ad and then we go a little bit better.

127
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,760
You know and this one could go right here as well.

128
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,890
So this one was done and was done.

129
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm sorry if this I don't regret it anyways.

130
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,030
All right.

131
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,130
Almost done.

132
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,340
There we go.

133
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,030
So OK.

134
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,600
So now after me the players we have.

135
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,590
But in so an action so we can click here and we go to the team.

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,550
Right.

137
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,300
So we need to bring a button.

138
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,430
Same thing that's attacked but the tag is going to be a link Tac.

139
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,580
So at the bottom we're going to say Open of course and again we use takk.

140
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,550
Now the TAC will pretty much contain the same thing in there.

141
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,740
But we're going to change some values.

142
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,660
So I'm going to say attack and the background instead of blue is going to be white.

143
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,880
So one two three one two three.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,680
Right.

145
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,610
The size.

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,850
It's not 100 pixels much smaller 27 pixels.

147
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,590
The caller will have that blue color so I'm going to copy this one from the top and paste it.

148
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,690
Now of course we need to add all the other properties.

149
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,820
And on this one I'm going to put it like light like this.

150
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,450
So link if you remember to make it linkable we need to pass a boolean true and then we need to pass

151
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,930
that link to property.

152
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,500
I believe it was linked to.

153
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,080
I always forget this.

154
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,710
I'm going to go to you.

155
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,760
I was Minsk and it's the link to property.

156
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,620
There you go.

157
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,920
So linked to.

158
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,410
And we're going to go to the route the team.

159
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,170
So Forth slash the team.

160
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,330
All right.

161
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,860
I'm going to add that we're going to add more things just like we did with apps going to copy this one

162
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,690
go over here at the bottom and at it we are still using the inline block.

163
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,870
I'm going to add more margin Bunim and I'm going to add or I can add a border.

164
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,240
You take a look we have a blue border.

165
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,230
So are going to go with the bottom and say border.

166
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,600
And we're almost done one pixels.

167
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,090
I want pixel solid and we can use this bluish color.

168
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:32,830
So dark and blue and the text for this one it's me at them here.

169
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,380
Whatever doesn't matter.

170
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,770
All right.

171
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,320
So we get it.

172
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,940
And if I click this I open a new tab.

173
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,410
I did it on purpose so he get the team very good.

174
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:50,030
So now the only thing left is going to be the carts and this one will be you know really really simple

175
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,470
not not at the heart.

176
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,520
There is a catch anyways and I'm going to tell you right now.

177
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:01,430
So you can be excited on the front for the next session so we can create an animation right here we'll

178
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,420
include that karst with the animation everything else.

179
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,800
Now the thing is that if the web page loads right here that animation happens in the bottom.

180
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,870
So whenever we reach here the animation will be done then we have done animation.

181
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,790
So we are now going to see animation.

182
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:26,000
So we're going to chain they react move to create the animations and we are going to use re-act reveal

183
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,560
as a callback to you know for years whenever we reach here Riak revealed will tell us to run to try

184
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,670
and function or run the animation and react move will do the animation.

185
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,960
So let's go to the next section and do the do the animation right here.

1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,290
All right so let's start building the matches.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,760
Now this is not going to be that simple is going to be a little bit long because we need to do a lot

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,500
of things.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,160
And one of the things we're going to be using that of course throughout the whole application.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,110
So we're going to do this which is this is a reusable component.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,970
We're going to see a lot of this right here.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,070
So it kind of makes sense for us to create a reusable components so we don't have to write the same

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,640
code several several times then we need to create a database.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,690
And then of course we need to create this tiny component so we can get that data.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,140
And you know create all this results.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,870
But first we will need to create the matches component create the reusable component right here the

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,110
matches and everything else.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,510
So that's the first thing we're going to do going to go back to our application and I'm going to go

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,520
back right here.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,560
Got to close this.

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,010
They've featured and everything else because we don't really need it in the x and the stripes.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,710
I'm just going to leave home right here.

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,800
So we need a new directory were we going to be hosting this inside home.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,420
We're going to call this matches.

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,470
So Majerus contains two different sections the index and then the actual blocks you know and the blocks

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:21,550
are this once it's going to create two files inside matches the index digests and then another one called

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,300
blocks.

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,220
So block is that.

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,200
Yes.

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:26,890
All right.

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,160
Let's get.

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,440
So now inside index that genius right here inside the x that is of course the only thing we need to

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,050
do right here is to return a stateless component because we will return the tag at the top the blocks

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,830
right here.

30
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,700
And then just attack at the bottom.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,140
Right.

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,640
OK.

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,410
So it reacts.

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,750
They list components.

35
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:57,500
And of course this one I'm going to call it matches matches home because it's the matches from home.

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,100
Right.

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,870
OK.

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,250
So of course we will need to import blocks but we're going to do it later.

39
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,040
And on this one the only thing we're going to render is just Divx which is going to be a wrapper class

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:19,020
name and then home matches matches underscore wrap her all right inside of here.

41
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,460
I will add a container because this is centered in the middle so there is a class called container.

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:33,410
We can use just like a bootstrap class name and then Container container.

43
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,560
Now right here on this component we will have a div with attack.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,850
You know just like this.

45
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,200
So check that we're going to have the blocks and then at the bottom we're going to have a tack which

46
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,570
is going to be a link and that's when it's not a link.

47
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,340
And this one it is.

48
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,710
That's why we use reusable components.

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,320
So we need to pass props.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,330
Same thing with it with the previous project.

51
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,860
OK.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,240
So I'm going to save it.

53
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,370
And of course we need to bring the matches to home.

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:06,210
So I'm going to go to home and inside home we import import import matches.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:16,090
Why not mattress from that for Slash and then matches.

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,290
Right.

57
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,020
So I'm going to make a copy and make reference to this.

58
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,900
Right.

59
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,380
But of course if I go back to our application we can ever get nothing so far because we are you know

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,320
not really rendering anything.

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,250
We get this.

62
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,710
But for course we're going to do it right now.

63
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,620
So first we're going to create that reusable component.

64
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,470
So I'm going to go to matches and the reusable component is going to be inside you.

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:49,630
I now this component the TAC is not super important so I'm going to stored inside a common file called

66
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,450
Minsk for Muslims.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,280
So inside misc we will you know return this component.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:08,040
So of course we will use some GSX so import re-act from react to it and we will be using linked link.

69
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:16,160
So import that link and then from re-act router.

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
No it's not the medium of the comp..

71
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,950
This is why import re-act router.

72
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,270
Dom.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,170
Very good.

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,510
So I'm going to export Barville a function called takk.

75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,410
Right.

76
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,200
So this function will be receiving some props.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,690
And then of course we return something's on just going to go ahead and pass prompts just like we did

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,280
in the previous project.

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,330
This task will return a template which you know some dip whatever date doesn't matter just going to

80
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,170
call it tech and it's out of here we will make.

81
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,670
We will check if the tag it's a link or not.

82
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,350
Again same thing with the default.

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:05,320
So if and of course if we have props that link we didn't have this problem so hard to get it created

84
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,190
in a minute.

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,600
Else we're going to return something else so if we don't have the proper link we will return the template

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:23,300
and if we do so we can return return some other GSX wrapped in a link right.

87
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,210
Makes sense.

88
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,910
Open and close like OK.

89
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,180
So the link and then go and going a little fast because we all did this on the on the priest on the

90
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,840
first project and it is really simple.

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,020
So in this one we will have a prop called link to which is actually the actual reference.

92
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,270
The H the direction you know the location where we're going to go.

93
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,450
And of course at the end we will just return the template we have right here.

94
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,790
So in theory if I include this from a different component we should be getting a div with attack inside.

95
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:05,770
So I going to go to the mattress and I'm going to import a tack from and it's going to be done that

96
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,380
for Slash the dot for Slash you I for Slash and then Misc..

97
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:20,060
And if I make a reference right here to tack take it out for the full import as tag was not found.

98
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,730
OK.

99
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,250
This is my mistake.

100
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:29,220
I am importing Ptak without this because maybe you don't know this when you export something like this

101
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:37,560
with not export default and we imported right here this doesn't know what to look if we do this because

102
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,300
we are importing something that it has the export default we do do not have the export default.

103
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,200
It's because we have many many exports.

104
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,610
So we need to import one of all of the file.

105
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,500
In this case we just import tag.

106
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,050
That's why we get no mistakes and we get the TAC key right.

107
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,810
OK.

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,040
So I'm going to go to the matches and now this task will have special properties of course.

109
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
So I'm going to go to tack.

110
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,840
We're going to go right here.

111
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,030
I'm going to add a VC K which is going to be the background.

112
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:17,830
And in this case it's going to be hash tag then 0 1 7 3 1 right.

113
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:26,160
I'm going to add a size property which is going to be 50 pixels 50 pixels and then a color with I don't

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,970
know white that white makes sense.

115
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,440
So white one two three four five six.

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,470
There you go.

117
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,960
So this tack will have some text.

118
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:45,530
So instead of making a self-closing attack I'm going to say tech and inside will be saying matches.

119
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,850
Now the stack has a background a size and a color.

120
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,860
So we are passing that as props.

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,380
So inside of misc instead of this components we need to catch up props.

122
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:55,860
All right.

123
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,220
So I'm going to go to a template and what we get to do.

124
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,100
Of course we return a div with some properties to do this.

125
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,580
So what we do we add this tile property to this to this element.

126
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,440
So we do have a background.

127
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,610
I'm going to say background.

128
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,980
And this one it's equal to props that became the thing we are passing as props.

129
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,630
All right.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm going to put koma.

131
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,860
I can get font size font size and then remember we have this size.

132
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,480
So it's prop's that size.

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,650
Now coma we have a color.

134
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,130
So it's color and I'm going to be adding props that color we do have that props and then we can add

135
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,050
whatever property we want.

136
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:47,590
In this case I'm going to be adding some padding five pixels and 10 pixels from the side to display.

137
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,910
It's inline block in line and then loops block what else.

138
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,960
Oh and the fun family fun family is going to be righteous.

139
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,550
So right it was very good.

140
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,850
So I made a mistake right here.

141
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,790
Righteous right.

142
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,130
So now if we rendered this it will render all the props and the padding and everything else so we can

143
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,520
get it.

144
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,830
You know it's it's nice going to get it Briger let me do this.

145
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,290
Now if I deleted we get this core bracket because we didn't have a text and we are not defining the

146
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:34,420
text as props I'm defining this inside of here so we could do we can pass prop's the children to fill

147
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,950
the inside of this deck so props that children right and reload it.

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
And we get matches.

149
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,770
That's good.

150
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,440
Now I'm going to show you something else just in case right now you're just passing.

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
We are just passing background on size and color.

152
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,540
What happens if I want to pass something else.

153
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:00,580
Maybe I want to add some special property just to the style of this one and I can not add this style

154
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,480
right here.

155
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:09,430
So what we can do we can create a special property that has some success you know some other CSSA properties

156
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,300
for example I'm going to say at an open close and are going to be passing just an object with some things

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,190
inside.

158
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,510
So I'm going to say maybe I don't know that color is red just like that's colored.

159
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,070
No I'm defining the color red here and I'm just really finding it right here inside of this property.

160
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,250
So now inside of misc what I could do I could do coma and do.

161
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:41,800
Dad dad dad dad dad props dad ad and whatever we have inside add will be added to the end of all of

162
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,710
this properties.

163
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,500
So the car red right here will override the color red right here.

164
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,530
And we will get a color red.

165
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:55,070
So inside of the property you can pass you know some cost to more specific stylings.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,950
And if you think about it this is what we do with material you I we added style and that style it's

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,050
actually a property from Matile you I'd not real style but we can override some default stylings with

168
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,860
our own own custom Starling's and this is very very useful.

169
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,380
All right.

170
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,570
What else.

171
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,380
So we have mattress and then we have the blocks going to remove this.

172
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,260
I don't need this.

173
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,870
There we go.

174
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,360
OK.

175
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,560
So we have mattress we have the Block.

176
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,630
And then we have a tack.

177
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,920
If I go to the original it's just attack with a small font.

178
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
But this one it's a link.

179
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,390
If I click it we go to the matches right.

180
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
So what do we need to do.

181
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,950
We need to pass the link property just like we did on previous project.

182
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,640
So I'm going to start all over again.

183
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,310
Can I say tack open and close the text on this one.

184
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,310
It's see more matches right.

185
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,180
And again I'm going to be passing some properties.

186
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,230
Copy this.

187
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't want to type it again so b c k of the background.

188
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,900
It's instead of blue it's going to be white the size instead of 50.

189
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,890
It's going to be 22 and the color is going to be that blue.

190
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,610
So I'm going to copy from here.

191
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,590
All right.

192
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,650
So if I do this we can get it you know this is get we can get it but it's not a link.

193
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,320
So we need to pass the property link true just like this.

194
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,940
True.

195
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,980
And that link to property if not we're going to get an error.

196
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm not sure if I made the link to the last link to it without clicking is linked to.

197
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,850
So if I open it close this one is going to go to the scene just like this.

198
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,120
Let me make it right.

199
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,860
The team we didn't have this route.

200
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,100
We will do it much much later.

201
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,890
So if I go over we can get the link right here.

202
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,050
And if I could get we go to our route of course that doesn't exist yet but we will get the top and we

203
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,220
get the bottom.

204
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,780
So now the only thing we need to do the remaining thing for this component.

205
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,030
It's the blocks.

206
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,030
But before we do the blocks we need to set up firebase.

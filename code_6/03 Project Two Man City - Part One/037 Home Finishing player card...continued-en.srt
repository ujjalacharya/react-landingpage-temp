1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,800
Write so let's create the player cart.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,890
So again we are going to use it I'm going to use the play cards inside of the team.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,920
Same same same components.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,700
So we're going to make it reusable component.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,200
All right.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,200
So I going to go here and go to you.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,850
I create a new file player.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,320
And then the card.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,400
Yes.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,550
This one is going to be a re-act stateless component.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,580
Did it work.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,660
Reacts the last component and it was like going to change the capital player card.

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,570
All right.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,070
So this play your card and right now we're going to make a prefixed information is going to be always

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,690
this player on the 4 on four images if you want later you can fetch the players from the database and

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,170
just bring four and loop through the four players.

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,500
But for now I'm just going to have you know hard code the information.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,140
So this player will be receiving this card will be receiving always some props with the name of the

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,330
player the number and everything else.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,600
Right.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
Makes sense.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:14,180
So what it will be returning is going to be a class name with play your card and then wrapper.

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,490
All right.

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,570
So now we're going to look at that just like that's going to go to carts and from here I'm going to

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:31,500
import you know these components so import and it's going to be play your card from and then that for

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,340
Slash.

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,070
Oops.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,800
Not that not three dots for us.

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,970
And it's you I for Slash play your cart right.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,630
So since we have the player card we're going to go right here at the bottom and include it by the components.

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,220
That's what the thing to do.

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,300
Now of course we need to pass the props maybe later.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,650
And actually we're going to do it on the team.

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,620
We're going to be rendering that card.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,160
And from the server we will fetch a list of all the players.

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,430
So it's always the same component rendering different name different images and different number.

37
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,070
And of course we have the you know the position of the player but that comes from the database I can't

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
worry about that later.

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,480
So the player card receives a number which is in this case 30 whatever.

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:24,870
Doesn't matter the name which is going to be Nickolas and then the last name of the player.

41
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,320
And in this case.

42
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,150
Yeah.

43
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,270
There we go.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,030
Then we have a background which is a background image that we're going to be using.

45
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,900
And if you remember we've imported that at the top right here.

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,010
So I'm going to put it right here.

47
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,880
So now this player card this component is reusable components will be getting all the props right here.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,200
So now the only thing we need to do is just finish the template.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,410
So I've got Dave opening close and am going to remove this.

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,620
We get to get a class name off and it's player card.

51
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,460
T t h him B for you know short thumbnail.

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,300
I got to put it right here.

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,100
So now a little bit prettier.

54
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:18,000
All right then we need to set the style for this with the background so background just like this is

55
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:24,900
going to be equal to we will use template strings and I'm going to use that you know a kind of a grayish

56
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,570
color.

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,770
It's not white.

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,130
You see it.

59
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:37,630
So the color it's a hash then EF 2 EF 9 and then f f.

60
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,640
All right.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,200
And then of course we need to pass a u r l opening close.

62
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:53,590
We pass that Propst b c k we are passing from the parent component B C K opes b c k that will go.

63
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,970
So now at least we get the thumbnail.

64
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,610
All right.

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,970
It looks weird but you know it works.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,870
It really works.

67
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,920
It is alive.

68
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,950
All right.

69
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:11,160
So at the bottom they've open it closed and we pass a class name of player card info.

70
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,560
Right.

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,070
Makes sense to cart the player info.

72
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,850
And on top we have the number of the player and at the bottom floating.

73
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,520
We have the player name.

74
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:31,740
So Dave opening close the class name its player card number and the number it's of course from prompts

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,100
we get from prompts Propst that number.

76
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,460
Next Dave open it close.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,220
The class is now going to copy this class name.

78
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,350
It's going to be player card.

79
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,550
And then of course names just a name.

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,910
And we'll have have the name and the last name.

81
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,270
So we have two different props one with the name and one with the last name.

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,610
So we'll use two pants props that name.

83
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,780
And at the bottom we will use the last name.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,610
So it's props.

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,790
That last name and that is when we are done with a player card.

86
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,190
So if I reloaded.

87
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,870
We are not getting it.

88
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,460
Maybe I made a mistake right here.

89
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,890
Let me just all check.

90
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,090
All right so for this it's name or no number.

91
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,830
You saw this and you say dude your mistake.

92
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,110
Well yeah I did.

93
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,610
All right.

94
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,900
So we got the name and the number.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,970
Very good.

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,380
Of course it's always the same player.

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,720
But again just like I told before from this one you could make a network request functionalist up by

98
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,350
at least four different players random players.

99
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,370
And then you go fetch it from here just do a loop and look for different players or you can pass the

100
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,420
whole list of players.

101
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,910
You can do whatever you want right here.

102
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,190
I'm not going to spend a lot of time because this is not too important for this application.

103
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,490
We still need to do a lot of things on this app.

104
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:05,640
So but this one it's pretty much done on the next one we're going to start with this with a jersey.

105
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,300
So this is fun.

106
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,120
Again we have a transition really simple but then we have this.

107
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,560
So right here we will start using forms we will need to create a template for forms for form fields.

108
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:23,430
We will add symbolic Deshaun and we just show you for example if I type whatever at gmail dot com.

109
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,170
Does a matter I'm going to say and roll and we get a confirmation and then it goes away.

110
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,930
If I use a mail I've already already on the database you're going to say already on the database because

111
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:42,070
the database right here and promotions we have a list of all the users that you know registered for

112
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,620
the mailing list.

113
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,650
So again there's one looks simple but it's not that simple.

114
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,310
We need to do all that logic.

115
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,480
But after we do all the form fields all the logic and the reusable code for forms and everything else

116
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,460
we are going to be using them on the admin side of the page.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,630
So this section it's really important for us.

118
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,570
So let's go let's go to the next one and do this.

1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,570
All right so if you're able to place this e-mail this user on the database on the Frisbee race database

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,850
I want to display a success message and clear the impot So we're going to do that right now.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,380
So the bottom just going to go right ahead and create a div just a div with a class name just like this

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,690
with success just like this success and then underscore all this court level and instead of here I will

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:37,390
put whatever message we get from this state state DOT and then form success just like this.

6
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,350
Remember at the top we have a forum success with an empty value.

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:50,170
Of course the application if we save it will reload and of course we get nothing because success equals

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,800
nothing.

9
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,750
All right.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,540
Now of course if we are able to submit the form because that date and the form is valid at the end we

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,840
will run a function that will clear all this out.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,000
So I'm going to say this dot and I'm going to call it reset form success.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,530
All right.

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,400
All right.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,910
We don't have this function we can create right now.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,200
So I'm going to go right here and reset for them success.

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,530
So this function will be pretty straightforward.

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,780
The only thing we're going to do just like we did with the update we're going to copy a make a copy

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,430
of new form data reset everything back to zero and you know update distinct risible.

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,210
So I'm going to copy this one just you know get a copy.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,080
OK.

22
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,350
So now we have a copy of form data.

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,040
So what we will do we will loop all the elements inside form data and we will set the value to nothing

24
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,250
devolved to false and we will clear the pollination message.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,770
Right.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,060
Makes sense.

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,210
So on the 4.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,190
Just like before.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:04,210
Let key in and we loop the new form data I can access new form data whatever key we are in inside the

30
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,610
loop and then are going to access value and set it to nothing.

31
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,620
Right.

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:17,140
I'm going to copy this one because you know it's pretty much like and valid and valid instead of nothing

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,950
is going to be false.

34
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,680
So we are just resetting everything back to zero going to copy this one and this one it's going to be

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,250
validation message and this one will be equal to nothing.

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,760
So now inside you form data we have the new state with everything out right.

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,250
So what we would do we will this.

38
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:46,300
That said state opening close and to do this we will grab that form error we have and we will just make

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:54,890
sure that it's equal to false right the form data it's equal to the new form data.

40
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,540
And then remember that we have a success a form success message right here at the top.

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,460
So what we will do we will make a reference to that form success and I'm going to say congratulations.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,000
We're going to do a little bit more later on this one because we have a different case but for now this

43
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,640
one will work can grab two lessons.

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,090
Right.

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,580
So let's see this.

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,770
Oh congratulations.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,060
Right.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:31,650
So I'm going to go over here but I'm going to add whatever and roll and we get congratulations and we

49
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:39,260
are able to clear you know the state of this know what we need to do is to clear this congratulations.

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,990
We need to remove it.

51
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,820
So at the end of this I will just create a different function so this that success message or could

52
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,720
be you know clear success message or something like that.

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,140
I'm just going to call it like this doesn't matter.

54
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,870
And the success message we will read and run a time out to clear everything.

55
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,920
So OK.

56
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,140
Real simple.

57
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,300
So we'll do a set.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,810
Time out.

59
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,340
Open and close we will run just to function and it will run after maybe two seconds and the only thing

60
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,860
that this one is going to do is does not said state opening close and we will change form success.

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,280
Back to nothing.

62
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,200
Make sense.

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,450
So let's try again and go to the bottom whatever e-mail you're going to do and roll.

64
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,520
Congratulations.

65
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,320
And it goes away.

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,120
So everything works.

67
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,970
Now later when we make this request we're going to do that right now when we make this request firebase.

68
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,610
All right.

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,080
If the user it's already on the database we need to return back from the server with an error.

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,270
You know the user is already on the database.

71
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,420
So on this forum success instead of showing congratulations.

72
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,240
We will show already on the database if the user it's already on the database.

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,030
So we're going to do that.

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,570
So right now there is one thing missing.

75
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,390
What is missing is this cause a locked data to submit.

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,930
Instead of doing this we will be adding this to database so let's do that right now.

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,070
So if we go to firebase to the database everything right here we're going to see something that says

78
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,100
promotions.

79
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,110
Now inside promotions of course we have many users.

80
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,040
We've added a few with France's different variations on the delete some of them.

81
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,510
It you know sometimes the database whenever we make actions right here it's a little bit slow when you

82
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,430
know it's free.

83
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,200
So I'm going to leave this Francis at gmail can handle this one.

84
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,070
And I'm going to I can really just eat just Francis can delete everything else.

85
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,320
So I'm done.

86
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,400
Yeah.

87
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,100
Yeah I went to the lead and I went to this one well as well.

88
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,900
So the only email the only guy we have on this e-mail list and the promotions it's friends is at gmail

89
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,070
that the only email that we have.

90
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,430
Now let's go back to our project and we need to go to firebase you know to that firebase file we have

91
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,540
right here and bring that table you know that document right here the promotions.

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,770
So OK so first going to go right here at the bottom and then will create again just like we did with

93
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,980
mattress of Barville to host the promotions.

94
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:45,140
So Konst then fire base promotions equals to firebase D.B and the RAF opening close promotions.

95
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,790
So this name equals to this name right.

96
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,930
If you make a mistake right here nothing is going to work.

97
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,080
OK.

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,150
So now we have a viral that enters that database.

99
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,320
So of course I'm going to export it.

100
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,200
OK.

101
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,750
So I'm going to go back to enroll.

102
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,170
And we need to import this of firebase.

103
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,610
Ryan makes sense.

104
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:15,540
So I'm going to go at the top and say import and I believe it was called foreign based promotions.

105
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,590
I have sometimes I have memory problems comes with the job.

106
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,400
From that that forward slash them for Slash.

107
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,140
One more and then firebase right.

108
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,740
So now we can use Farnaby's promotion to promotions to make requests.

109
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,710
Very good.

110
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,810
I get to go at the bottom wherever we have the form is when they're going to come in this one.

111
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,880
And you know this one.

112
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,480
All right.

113
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,690
So we need to do two things.

114
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:51,700
The first request is going to be checking if the user it's already on the database so we can enter promotions

115
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,960
and begin to try to match the e-mail that the user is entering right here right here.

116
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,370
And check if the user it's on the database if it is we're going to do something.

117
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,530
And if it's not going to do something else.

118
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,160
All right.

119
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,520
So I'm going to go right here and say OK first make a reference to fire based promotions.

120
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,640
So how can we check if the e-mail is equal to something.

121
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,830
First we need to or there or the information by child so we use the order by child method that you know

122
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:29,200
this is this comes from Firebrace and we say that we want to search by the email key later we're going

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,660
to get some error message some warnings actually.

124
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,660
And later much later I'm going to tell you how to fix it.

125
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,870
Resample.

126
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,570
So first we are the right e-mail ones we order by e-mail.

127
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,610
We say that we want to find the one that it's equal to.

128
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,590
And remember that we have data to submit that e-mail.

129
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,710
Then we use that once and we save value.

130
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,650
And then of course this will return to promises on the Close's will return a promise.

131
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,940
So what we can do we can do then.

132
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,590
And if you remember we receive a snapshot.

133
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,820
So let me bring a snapshot right here.

134
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,770
And then of course we can run a function right.

135
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
Kind of makes sense again.

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,430
All right.

137
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,680
So right here we will receive this snapshot.

138
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:28,120
So I'm going to say snapshot dot Bell and I'm going to cancel so we can see what we get from the server

139
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,040
console log and then snapshot how Burguet.

140
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:43,250
So let's go back so fight type Frances remember ribaldry have Francis Jamail on this database.

141
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm going to put it right here.

142
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,010
I'm going to enroll.

143
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,470
And the response is going to be this one right.

144
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,980
We can it we can get it.

145
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,180
So let me try again.

146
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,910
Let me update this right sorry for that.

147
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,010
It's a little bit slow.

148
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,800
So OK so we go back.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,750
So I make this request.

150
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,070
I'm ordering my child and I'm bringing whatever result I can get back on the database that matches Francis

151
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,260
at gmail dot com and of course we are getting our response.

152
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,750
We are getting this ID and e-mail Francis So we are finding a match.

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,970
So what happens if I type something else whatever.

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,300
And Gmail overcome doesn't matter.

155
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm going to enroll in what we get is no because that e-mail this e-mail doesn't exist on the database.

156
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,130
So what we can do right here instead of doing of course cancer look what we can do we can do and if

157
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,760
we choose if and else and if the value it's no it means that you know it's not in the database.

158
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,150
So we can push it to the database but if we get something different to Noul we're going to do something

159
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,810
else.

160
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,340
So.

161
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,670
OK.

162
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:56,780
So right here I'm going to say if SNOP short short sorry song and copy.

163
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:04,210
So snapshot that bell opening close equals no we're going to do a push.

164
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,050
We're going to push that to the database.

165
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,620
How can we push it really really simple.

166
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:15,340
I'm going to say fire based promotions that push open and close and I'm going to be passing the data

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,850
to met which contains the email and the e-mail and the value of e-mail.

168
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,350
Right.

169
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,530
And then of course if the user it's already in the database we need to do something else.

170
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,810
So what I'm going to be doing or going to doing I'm going to do this reset form success just like this

171
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,330
but this time I'm going to add an argument.

172
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,120
So this what is going to be false.

173
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,940
And the other one of course if you're adding a user to the database it's going to be the completely

174
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,350
opposite.

175
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,950
The complete opposite.

176
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,550
True.

177
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,700
All right so now this reset for success will be receiving right here a value you know.

178
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,910
True or false.

179
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm going to call that type.

180
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:04,220
So if rates of course if it's true it's congratulations because we added the user to the database but

181
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,030
it's false.

182
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,590
If it's false we can add a different message.

183
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,980
Something like already on the database so I'm going to go right here to the Whenever we set the state

184
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,660
of this.

185
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,050
So type if it's true.

186
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,200
Congratulations.

187
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:24,060
If not already on the database something like that resample.

188
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,860
All right.

189
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,810
And that is it.

190
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,540
You know I know it looks really simple.

191
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,870
So let's try.

192
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,340
Let's see what happens.

193
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,480
So going to reload the applications go back and remember that we have Francis and G.M. that come.

194
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,720
So I'm going to try with Francis Jima that come and we get already on the database.

195
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,330
And of course we are clearing the error message the impact.

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,230
What happens if we add another one.

197
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,540
So and roll.

198
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,930
And congratulations.

199
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,040
And if we go too far base we are getting the value right.

200
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,250
We are storing it.

201
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:07,520
So let's try me one more Steve and G-mail that come in and roll we get.

202
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,800
Congratulations.

203
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,290
And if I try Steve at gmail dot com again

204
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,650
already on the database so everything works.

205
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,410
So later I'm going to tell you how to fix this.

206
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,790
It's just a warning it's still going to work.

207
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,860
We need to add some properties right here to some rules to the database to get rid of this error message.

208
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,840
But don't worry about this right now.

209
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,180
All right so we are done with this components.

210
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:33,750
Right.

211
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,300
We are.

212
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,890
You're done.

213
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,090
There's no nothing else.

214
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,130
So if I check the final a final one the other thing is just a disclaimer.

215
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,970
So I'm going to just add some of it.

216
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,720
That's the only thing missing right now.

217
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,750
And of course we need to add to that with the class name because we have a different font.

218
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,960
So class name and the class name it's and roll disclaimer.

219
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,730
And again a pace that larm Epsom and a five year low the application.

220
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,800
That's it.

221
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Everything works very good.

222
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,560
So if I check again find one this is the last component inside home.

223
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,270
And we did a lot already.

224
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,420
So we have a lot of files already.

225
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,720
Look at all of this and this is going to get much bigger.

226
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,520
So OK so what are we going to be doing next.

227
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:31,470
So again just like that before we are fetching everything from firebase but we're kind of manually adding

228
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,160
this to the database.

229
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,690
So on the next section we're going to start with the log in part of the application we can add a log

230
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,290
in a user not a because not anyone can.

231
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,040
We're just here we're going to add a log in we're going to add some user to the database manually.

232
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,260
And of course if the user slot.

233
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:57,350
And we're going to create that authentication and begin to check the routes the user is able to enter

234
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,110
some routes and everything else.

235
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,430
And we will create and not been route.

236
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,170
So only administrators can enter that route so we can start dynamically adding matches players and some

237
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,400
other things.

238
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,890
So on the next action we start with the sign sign up with the authentication part of the project.

1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,070
OK so let's start building our application.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,620
So if you if you take a look at the final one we have some routes so we need to bring Briac Browder

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,900
to the equation and prepare the application to you know receive routes different routing.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,120
So first we need to include the CSA.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,940
So I'm going to go right here at the top and say import DOD for Slash resources for Slash CSSA for Slash

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,330
app that C S S Breguet.

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,620
So now again it seems we are going to be using routes these this file this app should be going to our

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,210
route files so the app that does instead of calling it up that just are going to call it routes and

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,000
touts know routes routes and no never update.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,900
Sorry for that.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,690
You know sometimes that routes and I can change of course because I have a theme installed.

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,800
It's the material theme.

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,340
So instead of index we have the upsy assess import app from app.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,750
Well not really now.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:13,030
Now we're going to get a route's file routes and from that forward slash and then routes.

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,730
All right.

17
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,370
So now if you remember maybe you didn't know this because you never worked with re-act router.

18
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:26,050
We need to wrap our application inside the browser router so we need to bring something from Briac router.

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,140
So gotta to go right here to the top and import open.

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:39,350
And then it's going to be browser and the Make It Right browser and then router and it's going to be

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,620
of course from re-act router Dom re-act router.

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,530
Dom right.

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,500
So now our whole application is going to be wrapped in this browser router.

24
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,840
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom create a function which is going to be our main application.

25
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,440
And this one is going to be returning just you know the browser Roder.

26
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:11,780
So it's return open and close but instead of here I make use of browser Roder now whatever goes inside

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,660
of browser Rohter is going to be our main application.

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Since we have a file to manage all the routes are going to include the routes right here.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,810
So at the end where we our main starting point is going to be up an app.

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,580
It's browser a router with the router inside.

31
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,280
OK.

32
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,940
So of course if we go right here you're still getting Kellow because routes it's equal to this component.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,760
Of course we need to modify this a little bit.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,420
Now what else inside routes.

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,160
Right here inside this file we will create all our routes.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,350
Right now we don't have a route.

37
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:56,150
We just have the home so we can look pretty at pretty much more if I dress up for just to render home.

38
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,910
And then of course we're going to be adding routes.

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,440
OK.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,300
So I'm going to remove this one from here we are not going to really use it right now and I'm going

41
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:13,260
to do this and I'm going to create just to function Konst routes equals And later are we going to receive

42
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,760
props.

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,900
So I'm going to put it right now.

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,890
We're not going to use it right now but I'm just going to leave it for future reference.

45
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:25,370
So just like the other component we just need to return something so we could return a Dave saying hello.

46
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:33,190
In this case and routes it's export default routes and when the application loads we are still getting.

47
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,790
Hello.

48
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,650
Let's get now on the main application to find one we can see that on every route.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,450
Still we get the hetter the same header and the same footer.

50
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,300
So it kind of makes sense for us to create.

51
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:55,770
I hide or there a component to store the header and footer because begin can show it on every route.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,590
So that's what we're going to be doing right now creating a component to store the header and footer

53
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,560
and we are going to create a high or there component to return a layout.

54
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,030
OK.

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,730
That's what we're going to do.

56
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,600
So first I'm going to go to source.

57
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:17,750
I'm going to create right now components directory not a file just a folder is going to be components

58
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,670
right.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,430
Now inside the source directory again.

60
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,920
And you can actually you can put it outside the source directory.

61
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,670
It's completely up to you.

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,250
Doesn't really matter right now.

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,760
So inside source I'm going to put it out.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,060
Yes.

65
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,760
No sorry.

66
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,670
We need to put it inside source.

67
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,760
But outside components or you can put it inside components going to create a directory outside called

68
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,320
h o c for you know high order components and these h o c pretty much is going to be the main layout

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,360
we can use on the application.

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,710
So now I'm going to create a file called layout that jazz and lay all that jazz is going to be or re-act

71
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,770
stateless component just reacts Nicholas components.

72
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,500
We are going to be receiving props later.

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,210
And what we do right here we just render something we say OK hello I'm going to say hello right here.

74
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,220
So now in routes instead of making a reference to that.

75
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,900
Hello.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,100
Right now what are you going to be doing is importing that layout.

77
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:30,750
So import that layout from that forward slash a Tosi forward slash and the main layout and instead of

78
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,080
rendering something right here I'm going to say lay out and I'm going to say second line.

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,120
You can see why in a minute.

80
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,320
So now we are rendering the delay out.

81
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,970
And inside of the layer we have a second line.

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,790
So if I go right now in relo the application the only thing we get is hello and it's because layout

83
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,510
is just returning Hello.

84
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,890
We are not rendering the second line.

85
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,800
So what I'm going to do right here are going to go right here at the bottom and say this.

86
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:09,210
Props props that children and whenever you know we we load the application we get hello and we get second

88
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,840
line.

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,000
So if we go to a different route we are still going to get hello and then we can to get whatever we

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,530
have on that component.

91
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,610
That is the idea.

92
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,230
We will always render the header right here.

93
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,270
The footer at the bottom we don't have them yet.

94
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,990
And any sign in the mid in between of the header and footer whatever components are going to be passing

95
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,390
here through routes.

96
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,510
That's why we use a lay out and a high other component.

97
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,350
OK.

98
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,670
So we don't have a header and we don't have a footer.

99
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,220
We need to create them right now.

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,510
So I'm going to go to components.

101
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm going to create a new directory called Hetter just like this and footer maybe underscore footer.

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:02,180
And inside of here I will start creating First the header that is going to be real simple so the header.

103
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:10,860
Yeah we could create a class or we can create a stateless app but for now just to be safe I'm going

104
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,510
to create a class so re-act classmates components.

105
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,420
OK.

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,510
So inside of Hetter we are going to be returning pretty much the header.

107
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,230
OK.

108
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,680
So from lay out I'm going to import the header import

109
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:37,650
import that header from that that force slash components for Slash header and footer for Slash and then

110
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,670
head or because we don't have an index.

111
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,610
So right now what do I do which is going to be I'm going to put the header component right here and

112
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,100
whenever of course the application loads or we go to a different route.

113
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,510
We will always have the header at the top and same thing later with the footer but could begin to do

114
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,440
the footer at the end.

115
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,870
OK let's get.

116
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,540
So let's create all the logic for the hitter we need to do something like this.

117
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,810
OK so for the better we're going to use the same material.

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,770
I bar with data on the previous project.

119
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,980
So I'm going to go at the top right here and start importing things.

120
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,030
So import it's up and then bar from open.

121
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,630
We need to do the at and then material the ice core and it's the same name.

122
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:34,900
Albar again if you remember inside of the bar we need the tool bar so import then tool bar from ADD

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,160
Materi core.

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,250
And you know same name in this case we are not going to use the material UI icons on this one and we

125
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,430
will have buttons this buttons.

126
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,280
So I will import import then button from add material to our core.

127
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,820
And then again button.

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,220
Very good.

129
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,100
Now we will use links because these are actual links.

130
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:10,980
So to use links and use reac rotor Dohm we need to import the link modules module from re-act Rotterdam.

131
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,070
So like.

132
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:21,390
And it's going to be from re-act then router and then Dohm forget you're going to use a CD logo.

133
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,430
And we have the CD logo inside icons right here I believe.

134
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,670
Yes UI icons.

135
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,710
We're going to do it later.

136
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,550
We're going to do it in a minute or so.

137
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:32,890
OK.

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,690
So first what we need to do.

139
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,460
I'm going to delete this and I'm going to return that abar from material to you.

140
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,670
I if you remember this abar need some configuration.

141
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,580
So the position just like before is going to be fixed.

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,920
So position equals fixed Frigga then going to use style opening close.

143
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,040
And I'm going to modify some of the default stylings.

144
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:08,000
The back ground color we can add that blue that light blue color is going to be you know hatchback 9

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,090
8 C 5 e 9.

146
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,820
That's the actual color.

147
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,840
Then again to add a box shadow are going to remove the box shadow unlike box shadow.

148
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:28,430
You know me shadow then it's going to be non of course koma are going to add a little bit of padding

149
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,850
telling pixels from the top and zero from the sides.

150
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,980
And one more thing.

151
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:43,190
The last one the border bottom and the border the bottom is going to be two pixels solid and it's kind

152
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,950
of a dark blue.

153
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,670
So it's going to be hash.

154
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,920
Oops sorry for that.

155
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,720
Or you go go go.

156
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,750
So it's 0 0 0 2 8 5 e that is it.

157
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,060
So inside of the bar we need that toolbar again.

158
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,870
So I'm going to open it close and make a reference to the material I toolbar we've imported at the top

159
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,660
and again of course we need to add some stylings.

160
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,640
In this case not a good one.

161
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,510
Not going to mollify a lot.

162
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,400
We're just going to give it a display of flex.

163
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,900
So this play and then flex and if we reload the application Well you know we kind of get it.

164
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,580
It's nice.

165
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,890
OK so inside of here inside of this toolbar container we need to add the logo.

166
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,780
So for now which is going to say def I'm going to add the style of the Flex grow because we are using

167
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,300
with flex on the parent.

168
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,460
So Flex and then grow.

169
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,930
And this one is going to be one very good and he's out of here.

170
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,330
We're going to be adding you know the logo.

171
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,130
For now I'm going to say Dave open and close.

172
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:59,260
And this one is going to get a class name of head or logo underscore logo.

173
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,350
And I'm going to put the logo in a minute right here.

174
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,980
OK.

175
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,180
So at least we get you know the word logo and it's on the same spot than this one.

176
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,850
OK.

177
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,310
So then of course we need to add the links and since we are using re-act Rotterdam we need to use link

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,760
from the top.

179
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:26,780
So I'm going to say link up when you make it right link open or close let me open and close.

180
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,010
Very good.

181
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,740
Now this link needs a property which is the two which is where we are going to go.

182
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,120
And I'm going to say two and they're rowdiest going to be called team and this is where we can see the

183
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,510
whole squad.

184
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:45,470
Next one can I create a new link and this one instead of the team is going to be the matches.

185
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:52,190
You know we can see the matches of the team and instead of here we can add the bottom from material.

186
00:12:52,290 --> 00:13:02,540
I so open it close button Breguet are going to change the color to inherit and open it close.

187
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,690
And this one is going to be the team and I'm going to copy this one.

188
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,830
We're almost done going to copy the team and I'm going to copy this one which is going to be matches

189
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,240
up matches.

190
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,390
There you go and reload the application and.

191
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,710
OK.

192
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,310
We can get this now with the logo.

193
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,260
We need to do something else right.

194
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:33,230
Because right here we are now saying logo but on the real application we will use the logo maybe on

195
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,920
different parts.

196
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,270
At least right now we are using it at the top on Hetter and then on the footer.

197
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,860
So you know it kind of makes sense for us to create a reusable component where we can display the logo

198
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,480
with the background position and the link and everything else.

199
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,240
So let's go to the next section and Korea and start creating reusable component.

200
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,110
Our first reusable component.

1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,110
OK so we can start with a second project of course.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,420
And of course this one is going to be much much harder.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,020
So I have the finished application right here.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,260
So this is the final one I believe this is final.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,680
Yeah this is the final one.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,780
So take a look at all the components we are going to be creating.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,020
So it's a you know a lot more work than the other one.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,820
And of course after components we're going to use firebase.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,780
We're going to get you our database and everything else so right now we have this.

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,360
But we're going to finish with this of course.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,810
And at the end we get to push the project to hosting and get hosted in firebase since we are going to

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,640
be using firebase of course on the third one we're going to use something else.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,340
But for now this is what we're going to be creating a Manchester City.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,580
I don't know if you like soccer or football.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,320
Depends you know the pen depends on your country you live.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,740
So this is a football team from England.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:06,370
So you know I wanted to do something fun you know something fun football team not a to do app or something

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:06,780
like that.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,970
It's really boring.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,890
So OK so this is what we're going to be creating.

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,920
So whenever the app loads we begin to do some kind of you know different animations that maybe would

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,950
reveal of course we going to use something else.

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,140
And when we scroll down we get that we'll transition.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,380
And of course then we get you know a nice animation maybe the image it's too large.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,010
And then when we go down we get again and we get to add user to the email user to the database for example

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:44,230
for a mailing list and going to type whatever whatever and whenever we roll of course there's one is

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,920
going to be stored on the firebase database.

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,590
Now then of course we're going to go to a different route.

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,790
So now we're going to be using routes whenever we go to the team.

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,050
We have a list of of course all the team.

31
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,210
And if we go to matches we get the matches with the table.

32
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,530
If we go when we get to apply a filter right here and this filter of course it's going to be pretty

33
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,130
easy because on the next one and the next project we will have a lot of filters.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,270
You know a big section for filtering and of course we need to communicate with the database and get

35
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,790
the filtered data from the database.

36
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,310
With firebase we don't have that option.

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,120
So OK.

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:30,900
So of course we need a place where we can enter first the team or the matches right here for example

39
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,460
home.

40
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,360
We have a list of all the matches.

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,610
So we need a place so we can enter so we can create a sign in.

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,410
We're going to log in with.

43
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,140
We can log in with firebase.

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,150
Maybe I don't remember the user I've been using right here.

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,240
So yeah.

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,710
OK.

47
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,140
So after we log in we're going to go to dashboard if you want to you know go to sign and we are going

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,450
to prevent that if you're locked then.

49
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,120
And of course we prevent dashboard.

50
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,740
If you're if you're not Altham dictated so we're going to get the dashboard mattress where we can see

51
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,450
the matches.

52
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,940
We can click on the match to edit the match or we can of course add a new match.

53
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,040
So this is going to be doing a lot of forms.

54
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,810
Then players same idea.

55
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,320
We have a player and we can edit the player or we can of course add player.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,450
We can be able to do that.

57
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,670
So OK players and of course we will store the images of the players inside firebase.

58
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,960
We can do a firebase uploading and of course we can't log out.

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,200
Right.

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,010
So you know a lot of things.

61
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,550
OK so the first thing you need to do is to create a directory where are you going to be hosting all

62
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,210
these files and my directory calls.

63
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,250
MC for Manchester City and.

64
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,520
OK.

65
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,200
So now what we need to do we need to create every act application so create then react then app.

66
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,160
And since I'm already inside the directory I can put a dot and press enter.

67
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,870
It's going to take a couple minutes and we'll be right back.

68
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,000
All right so everything was downloaded.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,660
So now we need to of course install all the dependencies.

70
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:17,920
We just like the first project on the preview section I gave you some commands for yarn at or NPM install.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,940
So I'm going to copy that and paste it right here.

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,030
So let me make sure I make this correctly on me.

73
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,680
There we go.

74
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,410
OK.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,420
Let's go.

76
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,130
So OK so your an ad we're going to use material to you I'd just like with that before then.

77
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,650
The three the three E's.

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,430
It's something for the Sing's.

79
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,000
So we're going to use a library for you know for animations which calls re-act move and D-3 ease comes

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,620
with know react so we can indeed to use it.

81
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:55,690
Then of course the firebase connector we're going to use a third party library to upload files to the

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,270
database.

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,960
But we're going to do that later.

84
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,980
And then of course again re-act reveal and re-act router because we can use route routes.

85
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,680
So I'm going to press center.

86
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,980
It's going to take a while and I'll be right back whenever this is done.

87
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,730
OK so everything was installed so we have all the dependencies right here.

88
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,030
So the next thing we're going to need to we're going to need is to put the resources folder and begin

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,670
to put some icons on the public folder or the public directory so we can use the images and some team

90
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,700
logos right here.

91
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,990
They're going to possibly put it right now on this section you have the resources.

92
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:40,890
So download both Cips the one for the resources and the one for the images inside public.

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,450
OK so I've added the images directory.

94
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,850
Remember to download the Cyp.

95
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,730
And inside we have some team icons.

96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,080
You know the icons that all the injuries of the teams so you need to use it because if not going to

97
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,480
have to do it yourself.

98
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,040
And now this took me a while.

99
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,840
What else.

100
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,930
We have the resources resources.

101
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:06,570
We have a pretty long CSSA And then of course we get images with some maybe a logo that we the pictures

102
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,490
of the players.

103
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,480
This is actually something I added just in case we can to use something else.

104
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:19,380
But the defense what else to keep them mid-fielder you're not going to really consume the images of

105
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,230
the players from here we're going to do it from firebase bed begin to do that at the end.

106
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,430
And of course some other images.

107
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:27,910
OK.

108
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,800
That's it.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,300
So now what we need to do the same thing we did before I going to go right here to that.

110
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,940
SS You're not really going to use it.

111
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,280
I'm going to delete it.

112
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,440
The jazz going to use that one AB test.

113
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,590
Good bye.

114
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,580
Move to trash that index that says the SS are not going to really use it.

115
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,530
So we won.

116
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:55,580
In this day as I begin to use it logo going to delete it and then service workers good bye.

117
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,460
OK so I guess can it clear everything.

118
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,510
And I'm going to say hello whatever.

119
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,910
And then inside the index I'm going to register service worker.

120
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,040
The ledes deliver the import for the CSL and I forgot to the import on the app.

121
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,510
So import logo could buy and import APIs VSS.

122
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,690
Goodbye.

123
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,200
All right so now I'm going to run the development server.

124
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,590
In your case if you're using NPM it's NPM start.

125
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,440
If you're using Yorn just like me it's just Yohn start.

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,820
OK so it's asking me if I want to run it on a different port because I'm running the final one of the

127
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,870
three thousand.

128
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,830
So I'm going to say yes and later I'm going to change it.

129
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,380
But right now I'm going to say yes and it will start to develop in server on the three 001.

130
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:52,970
And we should be getting the you know the hill low on was done and there we go.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,790
So.

132
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,430
Hello.

133
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,130
OK so we are ready to start coding.

134
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,780
So let's go to the next section and we will start with all the set up we can bring the routes and everything

135
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,070
else.

1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,480
OK so now we will create the wind and Jersey and the jersey animation and then we will create the n

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,100
roll impact with you know with a form.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,720
OK.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,600
So we're going to go back to our project and go back right here to our goat code and instead of home

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,550
of course we need new components in U.S. and then we call this promotion because of course it's to receive

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,640
promotional emails.

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,730
Kind of makes sense.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,990
So inside promotion we will have pretty much two different components.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,720
First it's going to be the index that we're going to have the animation container which contains the

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,020
top animation.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:48,740
So just going to call it any mention of capital and a animation could be promotion animation makes a

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,450
little bit more sense.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,400
But that's one.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,220
And then of course we get the end roll.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,080
So I'm going to say and roll that is first we will start from index.

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,340
So this one could be Chester react stateless component because you know the only thing we get into right

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:10,850
here is just make reference to the animation and the role so react statelets component are going to

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,290
change just to promotion and then promotion.

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,220
All right.

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:23,380
So the wrapper of this are going to wrap everything into a class promotion and then wrapper.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,740
And I'm going to add some stylings and we're going to do it on the CSSA I'm going to do it just from

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:35,010
here style open and close and a background.

23
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,630
Monique Fix's style.

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,510
There we go.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,850
It's a background of white just a black and white Nothing really special.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,800
So one two three one two three.

27
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:54,680
Now everything is kind of centered so I will create a class name of container's same thing we did before

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:03,150
and it's sort of here of course we need to put the both components in a Jersey Jersey and the unrolls

29
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,520
so I going to go to the roll and the and roll which is just an animation.

30
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,200
We are not going to use react.

31
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:10,660
React.

32
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,000
Move.

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,820
I'm going to use just react reveals a very simple animation.

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,540
So we could do we had we could create a re-act stateless components.

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:27,920
I don't know just name two promotion animation not just animation because you know anything could be

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,990
an animation.

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,860
So we just return some you know some constants.

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,990
So we're now going to say animation as matter.

39
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,560
And of course this component this index the index of promotion.

40
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,110
It's not being included.

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,130
We're not including that.

42
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:52,020
So first I'm going to import this promotion animation from.

43
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,690
And of course animation and I make reference to this right here and there we go.

44
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,320
And now of course from the index of home we need to call this index of promotion.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,160
So I'm going to go right here.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,080
Import promotion from that forward slash.

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,490
And then we go to promotion.

48
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,140
All right.

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,960
Going to make reference to this.

50
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,540
There you go.

51
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,840
Promotion.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,610
That and are going to go back to our application and we should be getting at least a minimum stake right

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,310
here when we don't check why import promotion from promotion.

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,380
Well this actually looks nice.

55
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,360
It's because I did it on the roll.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,530
Sorry for that guys.

57
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,590
Got to close it.

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,860
You know we're getting calls all the old ones I've been mistaken that place all the code of the code

59
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,150
inside and roll.

60
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,190
So we get information that is good.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,810
Get.

62
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,370
All right.

63
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,560
So now we need to start creating the animation and this one is going to be real simple.

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,730
We're going to use re-act reveal and I'm going to import soome from re-act reveal.

65
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,520
So re-act reveal and slash and then the name of what we're going to be using which is soome.

66
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,330
All right.

67
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,800
Now we will use an image of a jersey and everything isn't resourced so we have that image in resources.

68
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:20,360
So import levels like that and I get a call in jersey from that that force last one more time one more

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,850
time and then resources forward slash images for Slash and the jersey just like that.

70
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,750
OK.

71
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,500
So I'm going to read everything into a class name of promotion animation.

72
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,310
All right.

73
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,850
So we have two sides in this animation.

74
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:45,020
We have the left and we have the right so we have to get a container for both first one class name left

75
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,850
made this very simple.

76
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,140
And then of course the other one is going to be you guessed it the right one.

77
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,560
So right.

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,660
So in the left we will get some text you know when a jersey just like this.

79
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,000
So I gave the class and left.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Whenever we get a div and it's pen just like this of course we're going to get all the styling everything

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,910
it's on the CSSA So when a.

82
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,210
And below this we will put Jersey just like that me.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,170
There you go.

84
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,510
Jersey.

85
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,400
All right.

86
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,280
They are very expensive so you know.

87
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,470
So can we get it with Jersey.

88
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,430
That's very good.

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,260
All right.

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,570
So what else I want to animate this with assumed fact.

91
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,280
So I'm going to go right here and we're just going to do this right now.

92
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,030
We will put some end in sight of the soome.

93
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,520
We will you know put everything else.

94
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,330
Let me go here.

95
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,190
Ryan going to go up.

96
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,750
OK.

97
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,240
There you go.

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,330
We get it when we go up again.

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,000
Scroll down and we get it you know really or the symbol of this moment.

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,990
Next is going to be the year right.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,530
So they make this nice and again we will use assume.

102
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,360
So I'm just going to bring it right now.

103
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,440
So soome and instead of here we get that image.

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,540
So we will pass a div just a div with a style and a background.

105
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,950
Ryan real simple so open it close and we will say background.

106
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,990
It's going to be equal to.

107
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,040
And again template strings.

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,120
R l.

109
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:29,600
We use that jersey we imported the top Jersey and of course at no repeat.

110
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,200
Right.

111
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,040
And of course I made this already too gravidarum and make it at a position back you know just to get

112
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,940
the image right here.

113
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,130
You know the right size and everything else.

114
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,150
So let's try again.

115
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,020
If we lower the application and you know we get the same animation start again.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,850
All right.

117
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,270
You know that's nice.

118
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,650
All right.

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,830
So now we're going to go to the next section and we will start doing all of this.

120
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,080
And this is not that simple.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,190
It's not just an impact right.

122
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,170
We can it create a template for the inputs.

123
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,990
So we will add utility to you to the UI elements we will add a file that will rule all the inputs we

124
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,990
will need to add validation we will need to connect to the server check if the user is already on the

125
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,300
mailing list and to give a message if they are already already on the mailing list.

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,050
So again we need to do a lot of stuff.

127
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,870
So let's go to the next one and start this.

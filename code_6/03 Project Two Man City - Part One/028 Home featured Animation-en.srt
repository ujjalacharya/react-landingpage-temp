1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,960
All right so now we are going to be working on the animation you know the featured animation.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,360
So if I reload the application you know we get that transition effect.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,180
You know we're going to do that.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,490
And of course we're going to use a library for this.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,250
But first I have you know I have it right here.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,750
But first we need to do something.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,440
So everything it's happening and at home you know the route home.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,750
And so far we don't really have a route.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,200
We have a file that you know outputs play out and just a text.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:36,340
So what we need to do first is to create that home route and to add the routes right here.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:36,900
OK.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,200
So first are going to delete the one that has a second line.

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,820
And I'm going to bring something from re-act router dumb so I'm going to go right here at the top and

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm going to import opening close and first I'm going to bring switch and then I'm going to bring route

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,660
later are we going to be changing this when we bring out integration to our project.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,270
Now it's you know it's go.

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:09,620
So from re-act broader Dom re-act router Dom and then instead of the layout to begin to use that switch

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,730
and inside of the switch we will put all our routes.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,550
So switch open and close it right here we will put our route.

20
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,130
So so far we don't have a route.

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,260
We just have the header and footer and nothing else.

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,980
So I'm going to go to components.

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm going to create a new directory called home an inside home.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,490
We will put you know what we're going to be using in this case.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,540
At home we have several sections.

26
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,780
We have the featured.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,230
We have the matches.

28
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,470
Then meet the players and when a jersey so it kind of makes sense that inside of home we can have you

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,110
know several folders or directory with different things.

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,700
So the first one is going to be featured.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,180
So I'm going to create a new directory and say featured right.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,680
Inside feature again we have maybe several things so we will create an index that will host the different

33
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,660
files.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,700
And when the animation starts we have two pieces of animations.

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,800
The stripes in the background and then the text and the player.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,630
So I'm going to first create an index just so we can pass this one to the routes and then inside of

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,770
here we're going to have two different files one for the stripes.

38
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,310
So this one is going to be called stripes that Jesus and the other one is going to be called text because

39
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,480
we're going to host the text again.

40
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,620
You can use whatever name you want.

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,430
So inside of the index this one will just you know output the stripes and that and the text so we can

42
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,580
skip the class based components and make every act stateless components.

43
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,330
All right.

44
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,600
And this one is going to call it featured.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,510
I always do that with the sliders at the top.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,180
Call them featured.

47
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,340
That comes from from WordPress.

48
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,430
Back in the day saga.

49
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,220
So here now we are not going to import anything.

50
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,870
So the only thing we're going to do.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm going to return a div with a class name of featured and then rapper and he's out of here.

52
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,620
I don't know.

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,760
Some text from now.

54
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,350
All right.

55
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,350
So now this one.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,610
It's the main view for this feature.

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,860
And it's inside home.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,990
But the thing is that we don't have a home we have a feature but we don't have a home.

59
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,350
So now what do we need to do.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,750
We need to create a file inside Home which is going to be the index.

61
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,000
So I'm going to say Index non-jazz and this one is going to be the route home.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,800
So again react to Stigler's component and this one will be called home a copy home and paste home.

63
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,060
And the only thing we're going to be returning.

64
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,500
It's a class name and I'm going to give it a background S.K. of blue.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,030
You know we're going to get that this blue background.

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,840
All right.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,330
Now inside of here we need to output the featured container.

68
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:14,780
So import feature it from opening close that for Slash featured.

69
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,990
And of course we'll make a reference right here.

70
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,560
All right.

71
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:24,380
Of course if I go to our project and reload the page nothing really happens because we have everything

72
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,080
right here.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,700
But inside of routes you're not making reference to this home container.

74
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:39,020
So we're going to go right here on top import home from that forward slash components forward slash

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,040
home.

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,770
All right.

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,650
So I got a copy.

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,650
And now what we need to do we need to pass a route we need to define a route for home.

79
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,480
So with re-act Browder we're going to use this route.

80
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:58,550
We've imported to the top so I'm going to say route and make it a self-closing tack since we can have

81
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,790
made routes I can to put exact.

82
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,760
And then I'm going to put render.

83
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:11,120
So inside of the render sorry components we could use rendering this case but component is actually

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,340
more accurate.

85
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,450
So inside components we will put which components we want to render at home.

86
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,540
So in this case is just home.

87
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,620
And then of course the path where you know where we're going to be using this route so is forced slash

88
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,800
because it's home.

89
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,030
And now the application loads and we have that you know that blue background.

90
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,170
So you know at least this works OK.

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,840
So again I have a lot of things open.

92
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,610
I'm going to close everything.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm going to open round again and case of home remember we are giving a back of blue.

94
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,480
So now we need to create the animations and we will start with stripes.

96
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,740
So I'm going to go to stripes and we can it use for this tripes a library for animations.

97
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,060
Let me show you the library first.

98
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,210
So it calls re-act move.

99
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:06,790
And of course we've installed this re-act move now reac move to use some easing you know to use the

100
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,040
Sing's library.

101
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,460
It uses something else calls D3 yse.

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,950
So we've already installed this.

103
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,020
Everything is on the documentation of course.

104
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,910
So this one calls we are moved.

105
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,050
And we can create you know a kind of enhanced animations.

106
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,650
So again if you check the documentation maybe it's not that good it's clear but it's a little bit confusing.

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,400
But when you get the basics you pretty much understand everything else.

108
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,740
So we are going to do something very basic right now.

109
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,280
And then of course we're going to do something with no group because it's a little bit more confusing.

110
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,710
So let me show you an example and we act move.

111
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,140
So right here let me show you the link.

112
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,690
Go to live examples code and undocks and if you go here you're going to get you know different options

113
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,530
documentation more examples.

114
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:04,200
And inside the communication you have two types of animations you have animate and node group with animate.

115
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,280
We can do animations of something like that.

116
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,550
Well for example something like this you know they are they look really really cool.

117
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,990
So with animate we can update you can we can animate single deps or single elements.

118
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,320
Let me show you this example.

119
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,780
So what they do actually we just import animate and D-3 ease with the name of the thing.

120
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,060
And what we do.

121
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,110
We just render an element.

122
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,360
We have it right here with the tag animate.

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,970
And of course in this case it's creating several elements.

124
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,640
And so it's looping and just returning several animated you know attacks.

125
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,500
Now we will have a key of course.

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,060
So what we need to do we need to set up a start and an update.

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,030
In this case we are using update but we could just use just a start or enter.

128
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,990
So inside the start we will put all them the starting properties of that deck.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,110
You know maybe the scale the color or the rotation doesn't matter.

130
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,630
So then when the component updates we will get the new values and right here inside of a function we

131
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,110
just returned the div we want to animate with all the properties we want to change.

132
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,820
And this of course whenever they change here they will change here and they will change on the actual

133
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,410
element.

134
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,790
So this is the main idea this is how it works in a nutshell.

135
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,730
So you can animate single elements or you can animate groups.

136
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,270
And in this case a note group would be kind of an array or maybe an object with different think thinks

137
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,310
inside.

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,080
So it kind of works like this when it updates the computer and updates it shows the animations.

139
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,570
All right.

140
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,090
So we're going to use it again.

141
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,280
This is a little confusing.

142
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,810
And for example right here we have a start which is the starting point enter when whenever the elements

143
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,700
it's entering then when it updates we change the properties.

144
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,880
And when it leaves.

145
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,780
So it can react animations the featured re-act animations and you know a little bit different.

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,940
And you know this works really good.

147
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,170
So we're going to do it right now.

148
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:12,450
So I'm going to go back to our project and get it closed as and right here we are calling it features

149
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,020
inside of home and home.

150
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,220
Let's go to index a featured So we are just returning some text of course we need to do much more.

151
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,820
First we're going to do the stripes so I'm going to create a I'm going to call a component called Strypes.

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,320
We don't have this component we need to create it.

153
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,980
So we're going to go right here.

154
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,170
Import stripes from Dot.

155
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,850
Sorry dot for Slash.

156
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,180
And I'm going to call it Strypes just like that.

157
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:42,980
OK.

158
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,940
So this is Strypes of course.

159
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,230
It's not doing anything.

160
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,840
We don't have anything right here.

161
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,790
You can add it so we can create a class component so re-act class based components.

162
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,820
And of course it's going to be called Strypes.

163
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,520
We need to import the things and react move.

164
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,310
So import open and close and for the easy things you have many types of things.

165
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm going to show you in a minute on the documentation but for this one we're going to use IIS just

166
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:25,370
like this said Polly and that out and then from D-3 is very good that import and he made just like this

167
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,830
from re act.

168
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:37,340
Let me find re-act OK animate up sorry move and then forward slash.

169
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,560
And we need to pass animate.

170
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,120
So this is the way it works.

171
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:52,050
So at the bottom on the container we can every turn at just a div with the class name class name.

172
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:00,660
Well not after completing with a class name of featured shows like this and Stripes are going to make

173
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,830
sense inside of here we just returned a function that will loop the state of something and returned

174
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,850
three different stripes.

175
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:17,440
So I get a call that show stripes opening close nothing else show stripes and let me fix it.

176
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,110
Show stripe.

177
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,510
Of course we don't have this function.

178
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm going to save it.

179
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm going to go to show stripes are going to create that function and this function the only thing it

180
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,390
does for now it just returns returns some GSX so I'm going to put just a div and say stripes mind.

181
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,860
Maybe we are not going to be able to see it but we can get it right here.

182
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,280
Strypes so at least we are returning something.

183
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:43,680
All right.

184
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,170
OK.

185
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,380
So let's go to the next section and continue with the stripes.

186
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,210
And you know finish me maybe finish the animation part.

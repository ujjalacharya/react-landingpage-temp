1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,170
All right.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,000
So now what we need to do we need to render three different stripes.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,990
Of course with different properties different rotations and you know different delay and everything

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,990
else.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,640
So I'm going to go right here to the show stripes and what we will do we will map an array of objects

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,400
with all these properties.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,730
We didn't have this we need to create this I'm going to go to St..

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,010
I'm going to open an array.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm you are going to open up state and we'll me do it like this.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,910
And inside of here I'm going to say tripes now we Strypes is going to be an array of objects since we

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,460
have three stripes.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,360
We need to add three different properties here three different objects open and close.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,310
All right.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,490
So of course inside of them them we need some properties.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,650
So in this case the first one to just put background say back and then just ground and the background

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,410
of course is going to be the background color is when it's light blue.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,330
This one is white and this one again same color than the other one.

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,670
So I'm going to open it close and the color is going to be in.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,250
Oh sorry.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,750
Nine eight.

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,490
See five eat nine.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,560
That's a color.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,700
So I'm going to copy the same background for the other one pasted and pasted right here and this one

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,720
it's white.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,460
So once through one two three four five six there you go we just have a background for now.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,640
Then of course we're going to change everything else.

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,510
Now instead of here inside show stripes we need to loop you know how many stripes we get.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,760
We have four of course is going to render four different stripes but in this case we just went three.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,080
So we start with a does that state that.

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,410
Stripes.

31
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,990
All right.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,660
And I'm going to use a map and on each iteration I'm going to be passing a stripe and then the iteration

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,540
number the index.

34
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,750
Then I get the opening close and notice I'm not using brackets.

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,280
I'm using parentheses because we just want to return an element.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,100
So in this case what we will need to do if we go to the documentation we need to return.

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,160
Let me show you the first one.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,710
There's one there's one right here.

39
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,490
We need to return a new element calls animate and inside of this animate we need to start passing all

40
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,340
the properties.

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,080
All right.

42
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,690
So OK so I'm going to go right here and first I'm going to open it close and put the animate.

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,170
So then open it close.

44
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,040
All right.

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,780
Now we know that this animate returns something for example a div.

46
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,460
So I'm going to go and say div open it close.

47
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,900
Now this divide will have some properties and in this case we just want to add a class name for now

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,260
and it's going to be called Strype of course perhaps Strypes this one will be strike.

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,680
And of course we will have styles are going to put it right now and then I'm going to explain you a

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,070
little bit better.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,470
So background.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,910
I'm just going to say background.

53
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,290
That's it.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,710
I'm just going to say background.

55
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,170
OK.

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,350
So now this animate needs some properties in order to work first.

57
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,730
So first since we are looping something we need to add a key so key opening close is that the iteration

58
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,350
number we are getting right here.

59
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,340
OK.

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:25,020
Now this animation needs to know if it if it's going to be starting whenever the element gets mounted

61
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,920
or render it or not.

62
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,340
So we have a property called show so show in this case it's true we want to animate as soon as this

63
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,080
you know generated.

64
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,810
OK.

65
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,860
So for this case we're going to be using a start property and then we're going to use an Enter property

66
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,610
you have more we talked about this we have more and more properties like Update leave or you know yes

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,080
Abdin a leaf but in this case the element is going to start and then it's going to enter.

68
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,120
There is no update.

69
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,580
So there is no on an manhunting unmounting.

70
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,010
So we just put the enter the start and enter whenever the page loads and whenever the element enters

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,070
that's it we don't need anything else.

72
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,620
So for now we just have one property which is the background.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,560
So I'm going to say background right here.

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,520
Background and the background will start as white will always starts as white.

75
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,180
So one two three four five six.

76
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,680
All right then when it enters.

77
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,230
Of course with other ones for the first one the least in the in the last one we have a different color.

78
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,000
So we need to specify well from which color we want to change the element too.

79
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,800
So we're going to go to enter and say background and the background.

80
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,430
And this is kind of weird.

81
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:52,770
We could put stripes or stripe that back and remember we are looping this and these striped state you

82
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,230
know the stripes so we can x axis stripe dot background and get the color.

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,680
But we cannot pass it just like this we cannot do stripes and then background.

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,060
This is not going to work.

85
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,520
What we need to do we need to put it in square brackets.

86
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah I know it's kind of weird but that's the way it works.

87
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,460
So now when it enters everything is going to be white.

88
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,180
You know the first second and third stripe are going to be white.

89
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,820
But the first one is going to change the color.

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,130
The second one is going to remain wide because we have white and then the last one is going to be blue.

91
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,450
Of course if I go right here nothing really not nothing really happens.

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,170
We are getting this error.

93
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,920
So background it's not defined.

94
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,920
And this background it means this background you're kind of using of Barville to something that it's

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,150
not really defined.

96
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,430
We have background inside start and interpret no place else.

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,400
So in this case and this is how it works what it returns it's not going to be a dip.

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,010
So I'm going to copy and I'm going to copy right.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,320
Undeleted going to cop.

100
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,040
So what does it because it's going to be returning a function.

101
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,170
So first we open brackets.

102
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,680
Now inside of the brackets we need to return a function.

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,590
So we're going to open just like this and I'm going to return just to function.

104
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,550
All right.

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,570
Now inside of this of course inside of the function we need to return some GSX.

106
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,130
So I'm going to say return just like this.

107
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,080
Open the parenthesis and return that.

108
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,540
You know I'm going to paste that depth.

109
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,840
We were using before.

110
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,700
We're going to be adding some things right here in a minute.

111
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,470
And then of course I'm going to add this.

112
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,630
So instead of here we need a way to pass to this function.

113
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,670
All the properties we are using inside animate in this case we just have the background.

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,140
Now we look at some other examples.

115
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,620
We're right here maybe you get something else maybe you get state.

116
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,670
Well state whenever we make reference to state inside of here we are making reference to the state right

117
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,470
here.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,810
So inside start inside enter we get background so we can get it from that state state that start that

119
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,540
background.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,800
But in this case we can make use of ESX and I'm just going to say in this case background why my same

121
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,120
background because we are animated background so if we were animating opacity we need to pass background

122
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,230
and capacity.

123
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,580
And if we are animating top top background and capacity.

124
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,050
So when once we pass them through here we can pass the new properties to the elements.

125
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,490
In this case we are doing so we are passing background.

126
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,850
So in theory if I save this we should be getting at least something and we do.

127
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,470
And you know we get the three elements.

128
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,010
If I inspect this I'm going to go right here and let me select this.

129
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,970
We get one stripe two stripes with a different color.

130
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,340
You know this one is the blue.

131
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,370
This one is still white.

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,410
And this one is blue.

133
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,470
So it's kind of animating them all right because they of course start as white.

134
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,500
Let me reload and see if we get it.

135
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Well not that.

136
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,730
No not really.

137
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:07,760
So let's go back now this animation of course takes some time.

138
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,790
I'm going to close this.

139
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,870
And of course we need to define how much time this is going to take.

140
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,170
So I'm going to go to enter which is the last one in this case the one that actually does the animation

141
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,050
and we need to pass on this special property.

142
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,930
And only on enter that calls timing.

143
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,860
And on the timing we will define all the you know the delay maybe the duration of the animation and

144
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,990
everything else so we can set a delay.

145
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,600
We can I can put it.

146
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,710
I'm going to put 500.

147
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,820
We're going to do something else later.

148
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,110
But for now it's OK.

149
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,820
Then we have a duration now the duration is going to be of course Homan so much time is going to last.

150
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,330
So 200 it's going to be really simple you know really fast.

151
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,110
And then we can select the easing since we are importing at the top the D-3 East module we can pass

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,670
the Issing we want and of course if we reload again we see nothing because there's no actual animation

153
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,090
which is a change in the background.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Now we could see it but I'm going to do something else now on the original we are changing not just

155
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,810
the background color but we are changing the position.

156
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,910
You know how much of the left and how much this element is rotated by default.

157
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,390
It's just you know horizontal but we need to you know rotate this.

158
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,970
So again we just could get it from props we can specify right here.

159
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,570
What is the rotation for this one for this one and for this one.

160
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,230
And then the unmade will be animating this property.

161
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,820
All right.

162
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,300
So I'm going to go for a hearing and to start putting all the properties are going to say that we have

163
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,210
left and then I'm going to say coma.

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,370
Then we have a rotate which is how much is going to be rotating.

165
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,760
So rotate then we going to have a top where it's going to be positioned from the top because we are

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,660
rotating and then we're going to have the delay.

167
00:09:59,680 --> 00:09:59,990
Right.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,940
How much is going to take.

169
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,770
How do you let me fix it.

170
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,960
Delay Burguet.

171
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,040
And of course we get pretty much the same thing for all the other properties.

172
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,920
So I'm going to copy them and I'm going to paste them below here.

173
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,830
We're going to be of course adding something.

174
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,600
So they left for the first stripe.

175
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,250
It's 120 The rotate.

176
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,050
Going to rotate 25 and the top is going to be minus to 60 and the delay for now is going to be zero.

177
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,300
The first one waits no amount of time is just God is going to go right away.

178
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,120
The second one from the left is going to be three.

179
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:52,700
Then the rotation is going to be 25 the top minus 3 9 7 0 3 9 7 and then the delay.

180
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,280
This one is going to wait for the first one to show and then it's going to be animating 200.

181
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,280
The last one 600 the rotation is going to be 25 the top.

182
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:14,810
It's going to be minus 4 9 8 and then I know that this is boring but we are almost done and delay 400.

183
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,390
So now we have all these properties and we need to pass the properties to the actual animate.

184
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,170
So we're going to do that.

185
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,830
It's not going to be that hard work.

186
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,170
So all the elements they start with the Pasotti of zero.

187
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm not passing this and just going to do it directly from here.

188
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,880
So I could take opacity just like this.

189
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,880
And it starts at zero.

190
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,400
All right.

191
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,180
Coma.

192
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,620
Next one is going to be the left position.

193
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,890
How much from the left is going to go.

194
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,930
So everything is going to start at zero left zero right.

195
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,980
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom.

196
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:55,640
And of course we have more properties we two of them again are just going to copy this and paste right

197
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:55,810
here.

198
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:04,150
The one now the capacity of course we need to go from zero to 1 so we can actually see the stripe.

199
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,640
And of course remember to put the square brackets and then we need to specify the left position.

200
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,610
In this case we are using the whatever we have inside the state.

201
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,520
So it's going to be stripe dot left.

202
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,070
If I reload the page nothing really happens because we need to pass the opacity property and left just

203
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,570
like that with background.

204
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,430
Now same idea same idea.

205
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,090
So I'm going to go right here and say that we are passing now a left property and then we are passing

206
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,900
and passing the property.

207
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,700
Then we copy the name so opacity coma.

208
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,650
Now again.

209
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,810
The Stiles we need to pass this opacity and to pass the left of the left it's not going to be that simple

210
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,650
and it's going to look a little bit weird.

211
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:57,110
So what we use and see if we can get something on these you know on the on the left what we're going

212
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,430
to do we are going to animate with transform.

213
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,350
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom you're going to say transform and this one are going to

214
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,150
be using template strings going to close this.

215
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,220
So going to put rotate and we don't have all the values right now but we will use rotate.

216
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,340
So I'm going to put 0 0 degrees of course.

217
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,800
Then of course we're going to be adding this.

218
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,650
Then translate translate and inside of translate.

219
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,500
Of course we need to pass the left and the top you know the X and Y.

220
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,120
So in this case going to use 0 pixels and 0 pixels from the top and I get to go back to the first one

221
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,760
because we do have this property which is the left you're going to say left right.

222
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm using template strings.

223
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,610
That's the only thing I'm using.

224
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,990
And now we get something different.

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,620
If we load the application OK at least it's doing something that is good.

226
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,380
So now we need to achieve the rotation and the top you know transition.

227
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,960
So we do have this.

228
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,670
So we have the rotate the top and then begin to do the delete.

229
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,480
So I got to go right here at the the actually the actual tack the animate and after the left are going

230
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,100
to put rotate which is going to be equal to zero and then top which is going to be equal to zero as

231
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,380
well.

232
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,990
All right.

233
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,620
Now we need to pass the new properties right here.

234
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,480
So again going to copy this one at the top.

235
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:30,620
Go right here at the bottom and instead of zero is going to be Strype dot rotate.

236
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,220
All right.

237
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,120
And the same thing for the other one but the other one is going to be instead of rotate.

238
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,690
It's going to be top.

239
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,160
All right.

240
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,140
So now we have the rotate and the top property of course we need to add them right here.

241
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,990
So I'm going to be adding after the left rotate and top and then coma and of course we need to use them

242
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,070
inside the transform so the rotate is going to be equal to rotate.

243
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,180
That's correct.

244
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,450
And then we have the top and top again just like the left.

245
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,350
It's going to be equal to top of a mini mistake.

246
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,440
Let's go back to top.

247
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,940
I got to.

248
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,010
There you go.

249
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,130
I'm going to reload the application and you know we can get it a little bit fast.

250
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,440
But we can we're going to get that transition.

251
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,910
Now that thing right now is that they are all the animations are happening after 500 milliseconds.

252
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,250
They are all happening at the same time and that's why it's a little bit faster than than the other

253
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,120
one.

254
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,820
All right.

255
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,690
So first we need to specify I did late so I'm going to say delay that's that.

256
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,630
That's my first mistake.

257
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,050
DeLay should be a little bit slower.

258
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,740
OK.

259
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,390
Now it's a little bit slower but they're all happening at the same time and I need for this animation

260
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,960
to animate the first one then the second one and then the third one.

261
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,610
That's why we are passing a delay right here.

262
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:01,830
So instead of making a reference to a delay on the timing we say Strype dot delay right.

263
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:10,280
And that's going to save it just in case a reload it and we get the same animation that is good.

264
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,580
Right.

265
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,680
And it wasn't that hard.

266
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,970
It's kind of hard to understand what is going on when you when you see this.

267
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,610
But then then you realize this is simple it just create a new property starting properties.

268
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,470
You put the new ones and then you pass it to the you know to the function and the actual elements.

269
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,730
You know it's really really simple.

270
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,310
All right.

271
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,150
And that is it.

272
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm going to tell you one more thing that might be useful for you in the future.

273
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,340
Going to do.

274
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,050
Coma.

275
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,640
And then you have access to events.

276
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,520
So whenever this element it's changing or it's done any mating or whenever it's doing something you

277
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,970
have different types of events right here and you can check this on the documentation.

278
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,380
So for example if this animation triggers I want to know when when the when whenever the animation it's

279
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,730
done after the animation is done I want to maybe run a different function.

280
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,640
I don't know whatever.

281
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:10,430
So we can call and and inside and we can do console log animation and finished or something like that.

282
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,710
Everything is on the documentation right.

283
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,560
Animation finished.

284
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,850
Or go to console.

285
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,160
And of course it took me a little while to open it.

286
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,010
So animation finished.

287
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:24,540
All right.

288
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,840
So we get it three times because we have three different elements.

289
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:34,550
And remember that we are inside the map so that it said that that is the Zed with the stripes.

290
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,890
So now we are going to be animating the text and you know showing the player.

291
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,790
This of course is a passerby with a simple animation.

292
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,150
All right so let's go to the next one and start with the text.

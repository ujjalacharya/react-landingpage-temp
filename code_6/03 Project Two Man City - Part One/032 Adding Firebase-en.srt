1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,040
Right.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,560
So now what we eat it's firebase.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:11,420
So let's go to right here to the browser and we will search for firebase something like this.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,630
And of course the first firebase dash Google you get that one.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,870
So for this you will need a Google account.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,260
So if you don't have a Google account you need to create one.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,840
Right.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,750
So whenever you go to Google you know enter firebase.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,700
If you're not authenticated you need to log in everything else.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,880
And let me change this to maybe and or something like that because it's in Spanish.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,320
OK.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,080
So I'm going to get this maybe in English if of course you're in Spanish spoken country again in Spanish

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,460
but you can't get it.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,230
So right here at the top you're going to get go to consult.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,190
I'm going to like it.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,540
I'm going to go to my council and I'm going to get two projects.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,530
You're not going to get anything if you don't have firebase projects.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:04,050
And I get the test one because I'm on the incorrect place this is the correct account I was using the

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,970
incorrect accounts or for that.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,270
So for example right here we have the second practice test.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,460
This project belongs to this one.

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,820
So all my database and everything else is hosted on this project by default with firebase.

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,730
You get some free projects that you can run.

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,760
You can upload and see it in right here just like Heroku.

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,590
So this one belongs to this one but of course I'm not going to use this one.

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,710
Of course this one it's a new test.

27
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm creating a new course on the side.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,550
But you know it's going to take a little bit more time.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,760
So what we need to do right now we need to add a new project to create a new project so I'm going to

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,550
click on that project and mine is going to call AM city you know McIvor makes sense and can only letters

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,680
numbers and spaces and there's characters.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:49,970
All right.

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,780
So we cannot do it like this.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,880
We can do it like this.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,840
MC And of course is going to give you a D.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
You can select it you know the country doesn't matter.

37
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,030
I'm just going to say except and it will create a project.

38
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,520
It's going to take a couple of minutes.

39
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,030
Right after it's done your new project is ready.

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,310
I'm going to click and continue and you're going to get this you know this end point right here and

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,850
you get to get a lot of things with firebase authentication.

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,570
We will use authentication of this one database.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,930
We will use it storage.

44
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,290
We will use it in hosting.

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,260
We will use it.

46
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,160
So we get to use the first four.

47
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,130
Now how can how can we create a database.

48
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,850
And that's one.

49
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,410
OK.

50
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,150
If you scroll down.

51
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,330
Oh.

52
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,930
Oh I'm sorry.

53
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,230
This change actually it was different.

54
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,130
So I got to go to database and you're going to get this right here and this is actually new because

55
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,580
they've released a new new product called Cloud Firestar you know it's in beta.

56
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,150
So we are not going to use cloud for store of course.

57
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,990
Could it go right here the time at the bottom and or choose real time database real time database create

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,580
a database now and this again this is new.

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,340
Actually we didn't have this before.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,720
So it gives you the the option to run into different modes start in locked mode.

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,850
This one was the default in the past or in test mode lock mode.

62
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:21,820
It means that the users cannot read and cannot ride unless they are authenticated on the on this you

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,950
know this project.

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,920
If they are not then sign in or sign out they don't have the correct tokens.

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,820
They can not read or write from the database.

66
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,390
And if you start in test mode we have true and true.

67
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,270
So anyone can read and anyone can right now for now because we are just testing and developing.

68
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,900
We need this structure.

69
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,130
True and true.

70
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,570
When this goes to the to production of course we need to change this.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,110
So I'm going to click Enable and remove this one.

72
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,660
And then you're going to get.

73
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,660
Of course you're going to get this database.

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,020
And this is the actual database.

75
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,800
It's empty so far it's empty.

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,730
We will add some things here.

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,980
So if you go to rules later inside the rules you can change that read and write to falls or maybe only

78
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,320
if it's authenticated you can do this.

79
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:18,850
So I'm going to go to data and right here we need to add some data but first we need to connect to our

80
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,670
project you know make a connection between this far based project and our project right here.

81
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,620
So we will need to do some configuration.

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,630
Now how can we get the configuration and the keys and the password we need to connect this project.

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,310
If you go to a project you get start here you get three different options and it says at firebase to

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,670
your web app.

85
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,430
So I'm going to look at and it says at firebase do you wake up and it's going to give you the API key

86
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,670
the domain and all the other configuration you need to start your project and they give you this.

87
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,010
But of course we are not using.

88
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,000
We are not going to use this.

89
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,400
We just use this passports.

90
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,140
Now I'm going to leave this here and I'm going to go back to our project.

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm going to close some things there's a little bit cleaner.

92
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,260
OK.

93
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,390
So inside source are going to be adding a file that it's going to be doing.

94
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:21,350
The connection between the server and our project is going to go to source and add a new Fylde called

95
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,790
fire base that yes it can call this whatever you want.

96
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,200
Does the name it's not important.

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,310
So inside firebase we need to connect with our project.

98
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,890
OK.

99
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,350
So first we need to import firebase.

100
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,120
Why.

101
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:43,180
Because we downloaded a dependency called firebase that it's in charge of doing all this connection.

102
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,980
You know it's the kind of the SDK.

103
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,900
Now the SDK suffered some updates.

104
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,040
It was different in the past.

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,760
Now we need to do it on a different way.

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,920
It's still going to work if we use the old way.

107
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,100
You might find some documentation with the old way of doing things.

108
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,380
But now if you want to skip the warning messages we're going to do it just like this.

109
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm going to show you in a minute.

110
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:16,470
So first we need to import firebase from the firebase and then firebase and slash app.

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,920
This is the first thing now and this is on the documentation and it makes no sense but this is how we

112
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,580
need to do it then we need to import just like this and we open close.

113
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,100
And we pretty much do the same thing.

114
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,880
Firebase app.

115
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,210
Right.

116
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,910
So we are importing You know the app properties and everything.

117
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,070
Everything we're going to use from app.

118
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,230
All right.

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:46,010
Later we're going to be using a database you know the database property so we need to do import firebase

120
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,490
and database later are we going to use the storage so we need to import firebase storage and you know

121
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,130
we need to do a lot of things.

122
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,030
So at the bottom right here we need to bring all the configuration in everything we have right here

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,360
so I'm going to copy bar config and everything else and I'm going to paste it right here.

124
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,900
And since we are using a six I'm going to say Kunst config.

125
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,830
All right.

126
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,690
So now we need a way to start our application.

127
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,080
How can we do this.

128
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,160
Right here we have firebase initialize app and then config.

129
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,590
Copy this.

130
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm going to paste it right here at the bottom and that's it.

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,420
Now what we need to do we need to include this file from within you know our main application.

132
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:40,010
So far this file has no relation with our project we didn't include this file in our you know our project

133
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,970
our app.

134
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,470
Right.

135
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,430
So that's what we need to do first.

136
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,250
All right so now we're going to do a network request to get some data from the database because that's

137
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,780
the idea we need to populate this component right here.

138
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,750
This one with some information from the database but our database it's empty so go to database and you

139
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,700
can see this.

140
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,360
No.

141
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,330
So what are we going to do.

142
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,520
I've added as a resource.

143
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,690
Jason file so we can imported and generate a database so we can have you know some kind of real information.

144
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:18,440
Later of course we will create an admin and point so we can add the matches dynamically into the database

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,240
but we will do that that later.

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,270
Now most of the times when you do a web page or a project with the server you start for that with the

147
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,540
server first and then you move up to the front and front and that's what we're going to do on the next

148
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,380
project.

149
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,650
But I wanted to start with this first because you know it's a little bit more fun.

150
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:46,890
So OK so instead of here just download what I give you as a resource is I believe it's ambs city something.

151
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:54,710
Just download it and then when you want it to go do go right here to the dots and import Jason are going

152
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,800
to do that right now.

153
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,270
All right so after importing that file this is how it looks.

154
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,490
You can get the mattress which is what we're going to be using right now.

155
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,570
Then a database with all the players and the matches and the players are the ones we can add dynamically

156
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,580
from the admin.

157
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,200
Then we have a position with the position table.

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,250
You're not going to do this one.

159
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,500
I can explain you why later.

160
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,260
And then we have promotions.

161
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,070
And this is going to be the e-mails e-mailing list.

162
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,270
We do at home.

163
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,490
We're going to do later.

164
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,180
And then of course a list of all the teams and inside you know the name of a team and the thumbnail.

165
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,790
But can he be using from the public folder.

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,160
And we're not going to do this one.

167
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,500
Maybe I'm going to do it as a bonus but much much later.

168
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,900
All right.

169
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,080
So now we have some matches.

170
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,220
This is what we need to load.

171
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,410
We need to make an at per request and get the matches from the database.

172
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,250
Right.

173
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,670
OK.

174
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,940
I'm going to go back to my project and right now we have this file.

175
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,670
We are not including the file.

176
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,040
So as a testing purposes just to make sure we are connecting with the database I'm going to go right

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,510
here and import the file right here.

178
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,130
So whenever the application start we will do that.

179
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,840
Network request from this file but in real life we will do it from within the matches.

180
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,400
Right.

181
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,130
OK.

182
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,690
So inside of firebase right here.

183
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,980
Can it go at the bottom.

184
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,970
I'm going to create a viable where we going to be connecting with the database and I'm going to say

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,300
Konst just like this and it's firebase D.B and this is my name.

186
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,320
You can put you know database or whatever is that you want to call it.

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,350
And right here we need to call to a method called firebase dot database.

188
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:41,470
So firebase that database and that's why we are importing database at the top because we need to use

189
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,240
this method.

190
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,810
So we use firebase which is the thing we are importing.

191
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,900
And then we use the database.

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,970
So now in the future when we want to make a network request to firebase we don't have to do firebase

193
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,500
that database and then do everything else we just export fire DV and that's it.

194
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,390
We just you know creating an alias that that's what it is.

195
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:08,640
So now to access the database we need to pass a reference of what we want to get what we want to break.

196
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:17,480
In this case is the matches going to go you know to ref open opening close and are going to say matches.

197
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,210
Now the ref needs one more method.

198
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,720
It uses the once method and then everything that's on the firebase documentation.

199
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,760
So what we get is the value.

200
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,340
Right.

201
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,130
OK.

202
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,800
And then of course this will return a promise.

203
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,420
So we'll do then opening close and then of course we will return something else.

204
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,050
And this is the code we are going to get back.

205
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,480
So this then will return a snapshot could be response is actually a response but in firebase lingo they

206
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,170
call it snapshot.

207
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:57,940
Now if I do a log and I cancel lot what do we get back from the database as a snapshot we're going to

208
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,490
go back to home and reload and it's at least the application is not breaking.

209
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,350
I'm going to go to inspect console and we get this data snapshot.

210
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,540
And this is the console log again right here.

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,820
So if I open it we get a lot of things index key matches the no children you know we get a lot of information

212
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,390
but not know the information we want which is the actual data.

213
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:29,170
So for this instead of the snapshot we need to bring the bow.

214
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,300
So whenever we bring back all the application will reload and there we go.

215
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,660
We get all the matches and let me show you the structure of this structure.

216
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,120
It's a little bit weird.

217
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,550
We get you know the I.D. which has this I.D. and then you know all the information but it's kind of

218
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,090
an object with keys and objects inside.

219
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,520
It's a little bit weird.

220
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,680
We didn't get an array with objects we will need to transform this structure to make it work.

221
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,000
In our project we're going to get there.

222
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:08,410
But now at least we know that if we connect to firebase with the config and everything else we are connecting

223
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,160
and we are able to make a get request and they will then we will be making a post request.

224
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,190
So now we are connected.

225
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,600
That is good.

226
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,130
That's the first step.

227
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,670
All right.

228
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,800
So let's go to the next section and we will start.

229
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,950
We're going to we're going to deliver this.

230
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,580
We're going into this and we're going to start bringing the blocks.

231
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,730
We're going to start doing the blocks.

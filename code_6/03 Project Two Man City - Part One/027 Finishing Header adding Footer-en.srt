1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,910
All right so now we need to create this reusable component for the logo.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,230
So just like with that before I'm going to go to component's create a new directory called you.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,410
I am going to you know everything.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,030
Nightcaps you want just you on.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,410
And he said if you're going to add the first when we get to we're going to get a few right now we're

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,780
going to create a few on this project you know several components you can call instead of you you can

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,320
call it.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,840
Maybe I don't know Minsk or misc or Eutelsat.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,040
That's good too.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,190
So this one is going to be icons and I call them using a plural right here because you might have many

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,920
many icons on your application.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,290
In this case I believe we can have one but you know it's always a good idea to create you know a place

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,330
where you're going to host all the icons.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,050
OK.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:57,690
So this one of course since we need to return some react I need to import react from react.

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,050
All right.

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,950
What else we are going to use a link so we need to import import.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:14,360
Open and close and then link from Briac Rotterdam so re-act router and Domm and that's it.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:21,050
Now we're going to use the Manchester City logo if we go to resources and I go to logo's.

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,020
We have this Manchester City logo.

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,220
You know I like the logo.

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,130
So we're going to use it.

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,790
So ugly import em city.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:38,020
Some like this logo resemble from open and close that for Slash that dot for Slash.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,320
And then it's resources for Slash images for Slash Manchester City Oh yeah.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,640
Images of sorry Logos then for Slash.

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,370
And then of course Manchester City logos.

28
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,410
There we go.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,670
OK.

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:03,170
So now again like I told before this file might host several logos or different type of you know functions

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,930
or different code.

32
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:11,390
So I'm going to export Konst this concept called city logo.

33
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:18,320
So whenever we include this piece of code from a different component we just import the city logo and

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,780
we can get all the contents of this.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,240
So this silly logo will be receiving some props.

36
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,220
OK.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,120
So now I'm going to create a Konst we're just going to be a template just like this.

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,710
It's going to be just a justifiable.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,060
Right.

40
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,650
OK.

41
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:43,280
So this template will be returning something called Logo going to created right now.

42
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,370
Now the thing is that sometimes maybe you want to import the logo and you want to bring the logo and

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,340
maybe you want to skip the fact that this is a link.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
So maybe you don't want to return a link.

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,860
You want to return something that is not clickable.

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,710
So to make the we always need to make the components that were reusable components as versatile as we

47
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,220
can.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,880
So I'm going to make a logic question right here and I'm going to check if Propst that link.

49
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,340
And we're going to be passing if it's a link or not.

50
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,140
As Probst we're going to return something if not we're going to return something else.

51
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,030
So what when we return.

52
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,560
Going to say return if this is not a link is going to be whatever template we have right here.

53
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,620
But if it's a link We're going to return something else.

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:38,470
So return open it close and what we will be returning is the link we are importing at the top right.

55
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,980
Makes sense.

56
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,350
So link make it right there we go.

57
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,890
Now this link if you remember we always need to worry that the link is going to go.

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,460
So I'm going to say to open it close and then I'm going to add props and then link to.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,010
And this is probably are going to be passing from the parent component.

60
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,840
OK.

61
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,930
And he's out of here.

62
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,690
We're going to be returning whatever we have on the template.

63
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,210
So pretty much we always return the template but if we have a link we return it in linked form.

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,910
If not we return Chesed the template right.

65
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,420
I'm going to be adding a class name right here.

66
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,640
You know maybe a link logo something like that link logo.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,410
And now we need to of course return this template.

68
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:33,580
So first I'm going to go to the header and include you know bring this reusable component from the header

69
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,320
so at least we get that wart with the like.

70
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,860
So import opening close.

71
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,970
And if you remember I believe I call that see the logo.

72
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,630
You'll see the logo right.

73
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,130
And then from that dot for Slash you I forward slash and then icons.

74
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,890
OK.

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,740
So now I'm going to make a reference to city logo.

76
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,530
Of course we're going to get some errors because we are not passing props at all.

77
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,340
We're going to be passing it right now.

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,330
But at least we get you know we get that logo.

79
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,290
So now this silly logo if you go go back to the icons.

80
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,730
This one it's expecting a props that link.

81
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,380
That's what makes that different.

82
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,860
That makes a difference.

83
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,690
So OK so I'm going to go to Hetter and are going to be passing some props on this CD logo.

84
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,950
So first we need a link to evaluate if this is true or not true.

85
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,030
We can also do something like this.

86
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
So if it's true this one is going to be a link

87
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,190
and of course you're at it.

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,620
OK.

89
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,410
So let's go back in Icahn's this one.

90
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,190
It's going to try.

91
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,860
So we are returning this.

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,190
BURNETT Right now we have an error because we are not specifying the two property right now of the two

93
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,780
it's probs that link to.

94
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,880
And we are not passing that you know that property.

95
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,210
So I'm going to say link to and it's going to go to home right.

96
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,160
Make sense.

97
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,920
So I was going to go to home.

98
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,640
So now we're going to get this one right.

99
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,710
So we get logo.

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:13,090
And if I click you know of course I'm not going anywhere but it's going to take us back to home.

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,740
That's good.

102
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,410
OK.

103
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,810
What else.

104
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,890
So sometimes you going to get a width and height for the for the icons.

105
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,390
So it kind of makes sense.

106
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,810
So I'm going to go to icons and this logo instead of just returning this I'm going to break it down

107
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,910
and add some properties.

108
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,920
First they're going to change the class name.

109
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,400
So class name equals M G cover.

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,880
So we can add that back front cover and then we're going to be passing stylings.

111
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,890
So now what do we do.

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,180
I'm going to be passing a with and we get it from Propst.

113
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,930
And then of course we have a height and we get it from probs dot height.

114
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,550
All right.

115
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,050
So now whenever we include a logo since this is a reusable component we need to pass the width and height

116
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,560
in it.

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,420
Of course maybe you're using it on the head or so you need a different twist and hide.

118
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,100
So we pass a dynamic dynamic data.

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,050
Right that's the idea of doing all of this.

120
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,960
So we need to pass with and with in this case is going to be 70 pixels.

121
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:27,170
What else we can add height and the height it's going to be again you know square image 70 pixels look

122
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,830
at you know at least we get something what else we need to be passing.

123
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,570
What else we are going to go to icons.

124
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,370
So we have the wit and the height we need to be passing the background.

125
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,410
In this case I want to see the logo.

126
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,860
So I'm going to say background background.

127
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,030
Open and Close.

128
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm going to be passing some u r l because we will need to use some temporal strings and we use the

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,800
MC logo we are importing the top and then I'm going to say no.

130
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,840
Repeat.

131
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,530
This is just C Ss Pete.

132
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,900
All right I need to add a coma right here.

133
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,910
So now we have a dynamic width and height.

134
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,850
And of course this component is just for the city logo.

135
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,520
So we return a div with a CD logo.

136
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,810
That's the idea and I'm going to remove this and make it a little bit better.

137
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,710
There we go.

138
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,270
And if I reload the application will we get the Manchester City get the team and the matches.

139
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,410
This one should go to the right.

140
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,900
So let me double check why it's in the left.

141
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,490
OK.

142
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,940
I know.

143
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,690
I'm sorry for that.

144
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,280
It should be styles inside the header with the toolbar style and style.

145
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,310
Of course we were not using the flex property.

146
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,900
So we get the logo and it is the link and everything else it's a link to.

147
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,770
So very good.

148
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,040
We go to the team and if I click logo we go back.

149
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,070
So now whenever we want to add a logo with a link or maybe without a link we can always make reference

150
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,790
to this city the city logo from icons.

151
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,450
And that is it.

152
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
We don't need to do all of that.

153
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,700
All of this again we just include it.

154
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,210
And that is at.

155
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,110
All right.

156
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,180
So we're going to do the full arena.

157
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,400
So I'm going to go to header and footer and you file and this one is going to be footer.

158
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,650
I'm doing it right now because it's really pretty simple.

159
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,150
So this one react stateless components opening close and I'm going to change this.

160
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,350
Sorry I made a mistake.

161
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,140
Rename and capital F.

162
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,410
Same thing right here.

163
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,880
Capital F.

164
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,010
There we go.

165
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,090
So now the footer.

166
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,940
And if I check if I remove this for three maybe I can show you this later.

167
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,370
Why not right here at the bottom.

168
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,550
We just get you know a dark blue logo.

169
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,910
And you know what's next.

170
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,080
Really really really simple.

171
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,520
So instead of here instead of returning the div are going to return a footer.

172
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,690
There we go.

173
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,620
When we make the change right here at the bottom.

174
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,850
So this one will get a class name of B C K blue.

175
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,730
Pretty much what we did before.

176
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,640
Busy K blue and we need to add a logo so div opening close.

177
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,680
Class name and then footer logo and right here we going to do the same thing with did with the header.

178
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,260
Same exact thing.

179
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,550
Import.

180
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,900
We're going to bring the city logo.

181
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,930
Let me copy the name.

182
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,410
See the logo.

183
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,860
And then from dot dot for Slash.

184
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,330
You I for Slash icons.

185
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,610
So now again we just make a reference to see the logo opening close.

186
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,570
I could make this self-closing tak.

187
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,870
And then of course we need to pass the props.

188
00:10:51,910 --> 00:11:01,030
So if you remember it is with with the Riego and to with for this one is going to be 70 pixels just

189
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,810
like the other one.

190
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,250
Same thing then the height 7 pixels.

191
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,330
We could pass the link and this one it's going to be linkable so we can say.

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,970
True.

193
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,010
And then the change to this true.

194
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,160
And the next one is going to be where he's going to go you know where we can link it to.

195
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,780
So link to equals home.

196
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
And that is it.

197
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:32,810
So after the you see the logo that fooler logo are going to create a div with the class name of footer

198
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,750
underscore.

199
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,030
And this claimers something like that.

200
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:51,330
And of course some dumb content matzos Manchester Manchester City 2018 all rights rights reserved.

201
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,500
You know the usual stuff.

202
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:59,780
And if I go to the home nothing happens because this one goes inside the layout.

203
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:12,200
It's going to go to lay out in Port footer from dot dot for Slash components for Slash and or footer

204
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,170
and then you know the footer.

205
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,590
Real Simple is stuff.

206
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,710
So far this is you know we know this footer and the pick up.

207
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,140
So that's what we're getting.

208
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,950
And of course the foot hurts below the head or because the head or it's up you know position fixed so

209
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,380
it's on top of everything.

210
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,150
But we are getting the flitter at least.

211
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,740
All right.

212
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,110
So in the next section we're going to start building pretty much what everything that it's related to

213
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,270
the home.

214
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,860
First we're going to do the animations with this and then we can move forward to manage to do the matches

215
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:53,820
and with the matches we will need to create a firebase account create a database and get it from firebase.

216
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,730
We are not going to use a dummy database.

217
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,070
So.

218
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,260
OK so let's go to the next section and start the featured.

1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,110
Right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,760
So before we start with the actual coding are going to give you an overview of the three projects.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,210
This this one this section it's for the first project.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,250
So this is going to be a static web page.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,560
Right.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,050
No database no log in or dictation.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,280
So whenever the application LOTES we get an animation with some javascript loading with the counter

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,520
a count down until the event starts.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,930
And of course we get right here a carrousel right now at the top get a header.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,480
And when we scroll down of course everything shows.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,050
Now as we scroll down we get some transitions with the different sections of the web page and again

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,180
with apprising you know some kind of different kind of animations.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,250
Then we get the map and the footer You know it's really really simple web page.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,030
And we even get a side drawer and whenever we click it we go to a different section and we scroll to

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,820
a different section.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,970
Right so this is what we're going to be building on a natural and at the end of project is going to

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,270
look something like this.

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,930
So we will create a you know a lot of components.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,810
So again this is the first one and I'm showing you this because maybe this is maybe too easy for you.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,030
So maybe you want to skip it and you just want to go to the second project.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,590
All right.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,770
So this is the first one.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,540
Let's take a look at the second one.

1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,580
So this is going to be the second project in our course.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,790
So it's a it's the Manchester City web page it's soccer or football team maybe you know it.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,860
And again when the application Lote's you know we get a little bit more complex animation and we will

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,240
use a different library than the one we use on the first project.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,700
All right then if we scroll down again we get more transmission's and this piece of information comes

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,460
from D.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,640
Comes from a server from the database so we will connect this project to firebase so we can get the

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,780
data we need.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,560
And again if we keep scrolling then we have more transitions and right here again we will use that database

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,570
to store some information on firebase.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,280
Then of course we get get other sections like the team and the matches.

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,860
So if we go to the team of course we can get a list of all the players inside our squad key pers defense.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,460
And again we will do more transitions right here.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,170
Same idea with the mattress we can to create the matches endpoint and whenever LOTES can it get all

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,830
the matches of the team and we will do some filtering right here at the top with no wins lose much played

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,680
and everything else.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,310
And of course the table right here river is simple and of course since we need a place where we can

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,360
store the teams and the players we will need to sign in.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,360
So we will create a sign n end point.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,280
So if I log in with passport 2:59 real simple passport we can answer to the user dashboard and break

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,660
your rule at minister the man just the mattress.

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,210
You know all the mattress we see on the home the ATM match of course will add a match.

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,230
We can edit the players and add new players and of course of course if we log out we go back to the

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,870
log in.

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,140
So again we will create all the Alphen dictation logic for this one with firebase And if we go to the

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,550
we go right here to the project we can see that you know we get a lot more things going on here we have

27
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,620
a lot more going on.

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,290
So again we're going to do a lot of work on this project.

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,800
All right.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,620
So let's go to take a look at the third and final project.

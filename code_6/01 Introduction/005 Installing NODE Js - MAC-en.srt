1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,830
All right so the first step is going to be installing no doubt as if you're you already have no gas

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,680
in your system.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,050
There's no need for you to install it again.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,680
Right.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,470
So how do we install it.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,400
First we need to go to know just that Orrick and right here you can have of course the options.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,420
I'm a Mac computer so this is videos for Mac so you will need to download this one.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,590
I have this one I believe.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,010
But you can download this one or this one.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:35,520
So I'm going to click on this one and I'm going to go and store it inside that downloads.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,530
So it's going to take a minute and a pause to BDO and be right back.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,980
OK so everything was downloaded.

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,990
If we go to downloads you're going to get it right here if you click on it.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,430
Of course it's going to give you this window asking you for the installation times.

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,020
Now I'm not going to install it because I've already have node in my system.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,760
They have a different version so you need to delete the previous one.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,800
Install the new one but the the one I have is going to work just fine.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,720
So I don't want to updated it.

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,840
So we're going to go to continue then continue is going to ask you if you want to agree yes agree.

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,490
And of course the installation time.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,510
And then of course go to install and after everything is installed you just exit the installer right.

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,230
OK.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,320
Now the problem is how can we check if node is installed in our system.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,330
Since I believe you're using a Mac computer so you will need to do command and space and you know bring

25
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,940
the spotlight search and you do terminal of course you press enter is going to give you the terminal

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,150
and B we will be using this terminal.

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,150
A lot of this course.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,020
So how can we check if you have node.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,090
So first we say no.

30
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,600
Right.

31
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,280
Just node and then minus V minus V means Berson.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,860
So with this we will be asking the terminal the burden of node we are running in our system.

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,450
So if you press enter it will leave you the burden of node I'm using the ADA.

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,340
So I'm a little bit behind but that's fine.

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,000
So if you're not getting this it's because you will need to restart the computer so restart your computer

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,100
and then come back.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,560
All right.

38
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,980
So let's go to the next section.

1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,090
OK so the first step is going to be installing jazz in our system.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,940
I'm on my Windows computer right now.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,050
So first you will need to go to No.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,840
J.S. dot org.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,640
And then of course it will give you two options for the downloads we need to install this one or whatever

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,830
Burreson you're using in the future maybe.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,630
So I'm going to click on this is going to download.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,770
It's going to take a minute.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,430
It's going to the BDO and be right back.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,950
OK so everything was downloaded.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,860
So I will go right here.

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,690
I'm going to click an ad and then of course run.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,640
It's going to ask me if I'm sure.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,030
So let me give you and show this you're going to get this tiny tiny window and after a while it's going

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,060
to you know it will give me the next option is just kind calculating the requirements in my computer.

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,300
I don't have a very fast Windows machine so you know it might take a little while it's a little bit

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,110
slow.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,320
Just let's give it get the installer a moment.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,120
Sorry for that.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,470
All right.

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,780
After it's done will click next accept the terms then click next.

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,600
Of course it's going to be in program files that just click next.

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,990
And of course Cuca keep clicking next.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,090
I'm not going not going to install it because I've already have a version on this computer I might need

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,850
to upgrade it at but I don't really use know J as in a Windows machine I have the Mac machine.

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,180
So I'm going to cancel it of course you will need to move forward.

27
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,960
So after that is done after everything was installed correctly.

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,850
So we will need to check that node runs in our system so how can we do that.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:44,710
So I'm going to go right here to the search and type ACMD and I'm going to bring the command prompt.

30
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,270
Let me bring it right here.

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,740
So this is my machine the user's local machine doesn't matter the path where you're going to be.

32
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,310
So how can we check it.

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,050
Real simple.

34
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,170
We're going to say node and then minus the minus V means version.

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,520
So this will give us the birth of node that runs in our system going to press center.

36
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,210
It's going to take a second and then it will get me that 6 0.

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,710
You know I'm a little bit behind in this version.

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,010
So OK so if you're getting this it means that everything's cool.

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,560
You know you can use no jazz and your computer.

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,870
Now if you're not getting this and you're getting some summerlike command not recognized you will need

41
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,870
to restart the computer for sure.

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,390
So restarted the computer and then come back.

43
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,350
So on the next section I will talk about about the virus code.

44
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,560
The IDE Iam going to be using if you're a Windows machine I will suggest for you to take a look on to

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,360
the next video.

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,320
Don't skip it.

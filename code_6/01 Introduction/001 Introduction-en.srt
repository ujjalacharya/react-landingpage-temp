00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,820
Welcome to the re-act jazz practice boot camp.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,570
My name is Fernando and now we will guide you through this three practice project because maybe the

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,570
best way to learn it by practicing.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,130
So this course is for almost everyone.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,740
You need to know a little bit of yes 5 and iOS 6 javascript.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,230
Now if you bought this course and you know nothing about react don't worry.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,800
I attach as a bonus section a very tiny re-act course for beginners.

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,320
So with everything you need to know just to get started.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,790
So you're going to create three different projects.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,690
We will start our engines creating a landing page with transmission's carousels and of course all the

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,570
other re-act logic and we will deploy the project to search the second project.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,180
It's much more difficult.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,960
It's a soccer or football team web page and this one includes routes animations transitions of authentication

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,570
user dashboard firebase storage and upload database and much more of course.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,740
And at the end we will deploy everything to firebase and the third and final project.

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,770
It's a monster.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,970
We will create a guitar Web site e-commerce style and we will add carousels filter's detailed pages

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,700
use of cart Pay-Pal routes of authentication user admin and dashboard.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,420
And of course with this one we will create our own server with Express and no just and we're going to

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,630
use Mongo divi as a database and at the end we will deploy everything to Heroku.

21
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:44,130
And of course you will get a bonus much more additional re-act blocks for each project as we go and

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,440
it's going to be a very long journey.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,080
So grab the beans put the coffee on get a cup and let's begin.

1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,750
Write so this is going to be the third practice project in our course it calls wastes and it's a guitar

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,400
selling website.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,250
So we are going to sell guitars and when the application loads we get a slider a slider and at this

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,580
point it should be really simple for us.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,670
But then of course if we scroll down we can fetch and perform queries to note.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,060
A server using Mongo divi to bring the products we meet right here in this section.

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,190
Same thing right here.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,070
That's one it's best selling and this one it's by new arrivals.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,980
Right.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,920
And of course we'll get an end point where we can search guitarists and we will do some filtering with

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,900
the database.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,370
We can do load more.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:48,020
And for example if I go to Fender I just see the get the Fender guitars and fender and Ivan as guitars.

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,140
So again we're going to do a lot of filtering logic right here and same thing right here we can change

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,960
some some of the layouts.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Now of course if a user wants to buy a guitar they need the ability to log in or to register.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,080
So if I go to Lagann we can create an account.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,050
We don't have an account or we can log in and since I'm I'm already registered customer are going to

19
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,050
do password 2:59 again and after I log in we're going to get the dashboard with the user information

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,630
and the history of purchases.

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,140
Forget Of course if I want to go to the card.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,120
We get it right here.

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,330
But we can access through here and we can access to the card to the user at the items to the card.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,850
I mean we can of course remove the total and everything else.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,470
And at the end of course we need to you know pay the guitar.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,340
In this case.

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,640
So we're going to use the Pay-Pal connector to complete the transaction.

28
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,340
Right.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,120
All right.

30
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,100
And of course we get a few more a few more sections like updating the profile of the users.

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,970
And if we are an administrator we're going to create an endpoint where we can say we can change some

32
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,600
of the side information we can at TAR's including uploading the image and we can manage some of the

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,590
categories.

34
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,650
So again just like a just like it's all before this one it's pretty big.

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,260
We're going to do a lot of coal coding all of this files all of these files.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,740
So we're going to spend a lot of time right here.

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,270
All right.

38
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:12,680
OK.

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,200
Doing the server and the client.

40
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:15,710
All right.

41
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,850
So of course we can log back out.

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,640
So again this is the final project.

43
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,460
And on the next one we're going to start with the first one.

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,980
If you don't want to do the first one because it's really simple for you.

45
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,610
Just go to the second one OK.

46
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,590
So let's begin.

1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,860
All right so let's create that re-useable button.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,170
So from time to time you will need to use some code that of course you can if you're going to you're

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,300
going to be using the whole time in this case it's just a button because of course this is a single

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,400
simple simple application.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,070
But on the next to the next project you begin to do a lot of reusable code because we have tons of sections.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,870
So it kind of makes sense for us to reuse some code.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:35,090
So OK so we added first going to go to components and create a directory folder werent going to be hosting

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,780
this reusable code.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,450
I'm going to call it right now.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,040
But sometimes I call it.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,200
I know it's completely up to you.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,100
So inside you tell us I will create a new component called my button.

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,700
Yes.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,040
So this one is just a button we're going to do something very simple right here.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:53,870
OK.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:59,220
So this my button is going to be chose to react statelets component.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,420
So it's going to be called my button.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,580
So this component will be getting some props and pretty much what we need to do we need to use a button

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,140
from material real material UI material UI.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,930
So let me just show you the button first.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,740
So right here a component demos and then buttons.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,180
So this is what we can be doing.

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,960
We're going to get a button and we will be adding an icon to the button just like this.

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,520
All right.

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:38,810
So we're going to go back to our project and he out of here I need to import than Bunin from AD material

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,250
core.

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,730
And then of course button.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,770
OK.

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,990
Button up.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
All right.

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,640
OK.

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,510
So now on the if you go to the original we have kind of an icon for a ticket and that this comes from

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,740
resources.

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,680
So we have right here at the ticket icon.

35
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:05,950
So we need to import it as well so import ticket icon from opening close that that forward slash that

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:13,930
that for Slash resources for Slash images lash and icons and ticket.

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,610
There we go.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,530
OK.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,570
So instead of here the only thing that this component will return is the material you buy button just

40
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,590
like this button open and close and this button will have the image and the text.

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,850
But we're going to be passing the text.

42
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,260
What we have inside the button through prompts and a lot of other properties properties through prompts.

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,590
So first we're going to just create the button EMG.

44
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,460
We have a source and the source is going to be ticket icon just like this.

45
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,310
Me make it like this so we can you know it's a little bit nicer.

46
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,060
And then I get to close the stack.

47
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:05,080
So instead it's going to be adding a class a class name of icon and then image and I will add an alt.

48
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,750
If not you're going to get a warning.

49
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,240
So icon buttons something very very simple.

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,820
So then we're going to have a text of button whatever.

51
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,910
Doesn't matter right now.

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,370
And this button needs some configuration.

53
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:23,810
This material component needs some configuration if you want to make the button a link just because

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,030
it is a link.

55
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,710
We need to add an H ref property.

56
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,220
So right now I'm just going to be adding Google that come.

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,480
But BKB passing the ref through prompts.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,070
So then we need a variant.

59
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,460
And this is one of the props of you know of button and we have several options in this case.

60
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm going to use contained the size the size is going to be small and we could pass all of this as props

61
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,520
but you're not really going to.

62
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,280
So then style open and close and then background going to change the background too.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,500
And I'm going to be passing the background color through props so props that b c k.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,410
Actually we didn't have it so far ascending it with just maybe red.

65
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:18,160
And then the caller is going to be I don't know what are we going to get kind of a template right now.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,250
So now instead of discount we need to include this Bonnin and use it.

67
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,670
So I'm going to go to this account and we go at the top and import the Bunin from you Tilse.

68
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,180
So import my button.

69
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,930
There you go.

70
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:45,080
My button from that that forward slash utilities for slash my button and I get a copy in my bottom and

71
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:53,240
included of course we're going to get a dumb button but a dummy button but doesn't matter right now.

72
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,510
All right.

73
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,400
Let's see what we get.

74
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,650
So I'm going to go to the our product.

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,180
You know we get the button if I click it is going to take us to Google that come.

76
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:02,990
All right.

77
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,520
So you know we get the Bunim.

78
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,790
So no if you are maybe on a different component and we bring a button and then of course we put the

79
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,340
component my blood and right here you get to get the button doesn't matter if we are in highlights or

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,870
featured or whatever.

81
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,120
So this is a reusable component.

82
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,430
Now.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,020
My button needs to be sending some props because maybe you want to change the color or maybe we went

84
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,340
into the link to be on a different to do different location.

85
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,630
So we need to pass the props as props.

86
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,910
We are getting it right here.

87
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,620
So I'm going to go right here and again to say that text is going to be equal to.

88
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:50,130
I don't know in this K purchased tickets let me do a capital P purchase and then tickets next the b

89
00:05:50,130 --> 00:06:00,130
c k which is the background I'm going to use the yellow color f f 8 I'm sorry f f A then 8 0 0 0.

90
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,990
Then the color is going to be equal to white color.

91
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,670
One two three.

92
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,150
One two three.

93
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,090
And then the ref or I'm going to call it like better.

94
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,270
So I don't know.

95
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,120
And so this one is going to be maybe the same thing we were using right here.

96
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,340
Google's outcome doesn't matter.

97
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,830
OK so now this my but in this use of component will be receiving all these prompts so we can use the

98
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,210
props right here.

99
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:37,070
We can access prompts when say say Propst that text and we can get the purchase tickets so we are rendering

100
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,250
the reusable component with the props of whatever we are you know including my button.

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,040
Then we have the basic K which is the background.

102
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,120
So I'm going to say props that b c k we have the color I believe I called it.

103
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,060
Caller Yeah.

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,340
So props dot color I can to save it.

105
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,730
And we get the yellow and the white collar so next one it's going to be the link.

106
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:12,020
So on the property kind of opening close and we say props that link I believe I called that link.

107
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,960
Yes.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,250
All right.

109
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,310
So if I look it we go to Google you know that works right.

110
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,280
So this reusable component.

111
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,540
This button we will be using the button right here.

112
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,380
So now there is no need to redo this code again.

113
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,040
We just import it call it pass the prompts.

114
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,020
And that is it.

115
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,140
Right.

116
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,430
How easy is that.

117
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,120
OK.

118
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,210
So I'm going to of course skip the project.

119
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,000
The code we have so far which is this one.

120
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,710
And you can download it and maybe inspect if something is not working in your project.

121
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,810
And of course we're going to be moving forward to prizing and then you know the location and the footer

122
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,330
which is they are going to be really really simple.

123
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,540
And then of course we're going to be passing to the next project which is going to be you know pretty

124
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,740
not pretty hard but you know hard enough.

125
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:04,910
OK.

126
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,200
So let's go to the next section and do the pricing.

1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,930
OK so let's begin doing this.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,680
So I've created this you know I've changed the color of the terminal you know a little bit better.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,590
So we have this screen and then on another tab I have the other you know the finished project so this

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,550
is what we're going to be doing right now.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,730
Of course before I buy record this course this practice course I have all the projects finished so you

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,060
know I could have a reference.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,670
So OK.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
So this is what we're going to do and we're going to start with Hetter.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,770
So whenever the pitch loads we get Hetter and it's transparent.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,790
And whenever we scroll down we get a caller.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,530
And of course it disappears when we reach the top.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,440
And then of course we have the side drawer.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,260
And if we click on an item going to go to a new section so we're going to start with Hetter OK.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,810
So let's go back to our project.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,150
So first the index which is the first to file and we're going to leave it just like it is.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,000
We don't need to change anything here but we're going to change the app that jazz which is the other

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,820
entry point the main entry point of our application in this case.

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,550
We're going to be using the CSSA we have in we sources and we get it injected right here.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,520
So I'm going to say import open and close that force slash resources for Slash and then styles.

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,630
So the styles will be injected in our application so whenever we use a class name we will get it right.

21
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,690
So right now we didn't have Hetter.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,610
So we can create a directory inside the source which is going to be called components components and

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,960
inside components.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,880
Of course we need to create the header.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,890
So okay.

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,610
So I'm going to go to component's new folder and I'm going to store the header header dash and then

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,210
footer.

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,880
So I'm going to store the header and footer on the same place.

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:54,590
So for the header I'm just going to create a new file call called header dodginess and the header dodgiest

30
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,270
is going to be a class based component.

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,500
Now and this is I will tell you this and if you're using VBA code it's going to be really helpful helpful

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,490
for you.

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,510
I'm going to be using some snippets for example I'm going to say re-act class based component and if

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,030
I press enter it will give me all the lay out for this.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,390
So this is a plug in.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,260
I have installed and he will recommend for you to install it.

37
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,780
It's going to be called re-acclimate search for this re-act native.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,170
No not this one.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,730
Let me find it.

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,460
Because they have a lot of you know installed plug ins so all me find it.

41
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:43,390
You have the material team which is which is the one I'm using right here with all the icons on me see

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,750
reac native No react to you as coach snippet.

43
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,380
So this is the one so whenever we type something R-S.C. we get a class based component and same thing

44
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,830
with statelets component.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,360
So if you're not using this you know this there's when it's really really great.

46
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,820
That's the first thing.

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,300
OK.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,450
So first we create a class based component and this one is going to be called header.

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,030
And let me change this header.

50
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,330
Come and I'm going to change the name of the file with a capital H.

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,020
OK.

52
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,820
So OK so we have the header.

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,480
We have a class based component.

54
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,000
And for now I'm going to just return Hetter.

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,090
So we need to import Hetter from from the app dodginess.

56
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,480
So I going to go right here and say import Hetter then it's going to be from.

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:38,110
And that for Slash components for Slash header and footer and it's going to be header.

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,100
OK.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm going to make a reference and that's it.

60
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,000
If the page is going to reload and we get Hetter which is the text we have right here really really

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
simple.

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,910
So to start we need to bring things from material UI.

63
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,100
So I'm going to go right here and say import and then app bar just like this app bar end with a capital

64
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:11,460
B and then from and then it's going to be at and then material you eye core and then for Slash and then

65
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,310
app bar we need to bring a few things we are going to go right now to mature UI and show you what this

66
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,220
is all about.

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:27,620
That import and then toolbar just like this toolbar and toolbar There we go from.

68
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,540
And same thing add material.

69
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,800
Core and same tack toolbar when we copy and paste.

70
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,460
All right.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,350
So then we have to import menu icon.

72
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,390
So import menu icon.

73
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,910
There we go from at mature UI core for Slash.

74
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,090
And this one instead of menu icons is going to be menu.

75
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,140
So it's like a dependency.

76
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:04,790
And the last one is going to be I combine an import icon button from opening close at Mattioli or ice

77
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,600
core for Slash and same name.

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,480
All right so this is what we're going to be using at first.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,300
Solutio you first something about virtual UI OK.

80
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:25,550
So if I go to the if I go to Google and Google material you I can get this really the world most popular

81
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,670
re-act UI framework.

82
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,400
So we get to go and enter there and mature you I would it this is pretty much like I don't know Jake

83
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,950
Querrey but for react so we're going to get a lot of components right from the you know from the start

84
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,450
and we can use them in our applications.

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,870
So I'm sure you're right here if we go to the the options you can have you can get the components demos

86
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,180
go to component demo and go to a bar which is the one we're importing right here at the top.

87
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,790
I'm going to go to a bar and this is what you get.

88
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,180
You get some examples of what you can do with this bar and this is what actually are going to be doing

89
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,960
if we go to the final project.

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,050
We have an icon.

91
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,940
We have a button and then you know we have the app bar so we can use it as a header.

92
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,290
So if I open the show resource showed a show source of this right.

93
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,740
We're importing the same things on bar then the toolbar button.

94
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,190
So I'm sorry I can button so we can click on this on this button.

95
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,450
And of course menu icon so we need to install this as you know bring it on the on the on our component

96
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,300
so we can use it.

97
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,680
So again Marjorie until you die it's really really cool.

98
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,040
And we can be using it a lot for a lot of things.

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,410
All right.

100
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,940
So can it cause us and we're going to go back to our application.

101
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,910
So right now we're not doing anything.

102
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,560
First we need to create an app bar so I'm going to delete this.

103
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,470
I'm going to do.

104
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,460
Up up and then bar open it close.

105
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,970
Now this bar meets some specifications and this is actually comes from Riyadh UI.

106
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,390
I'm sorry from material UI and the bar which is the header we can set it you know in the relative position

107
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,630
where we can use it as a position fixed.

108
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,630
So if I say position equal to fixed and then let me put something right here.

109
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,050
Header is going to start as a position fixed right.

110
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,610
Right from start to get the background.

111
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,640
And of course right now I cannot test it because the height of the web page it's not long enough so.

112
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,950
But you know don't worry we can begin to simulate this later.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,750
So what else.

114
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,010
I want to change the background color because that's when it's really really ugly.

115
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,980
And if you remember we have kind of a transparent or black kind of color.

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,320
So for now how can we change the styles.

117
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,490
I'm going to go right here.

118
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,760
Say style opening close and we can get past the styles right here.

119
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,070
First we need a background color so background and then color just like this.

120
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,880
And I'm going to use that grayish color.

121
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:04,940
So it's to f f f then coma I'm going to change the box shadow.

122
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,380
And then going to change it to none because I don't like the box shadows shadows then panning and 10

123
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,660
pixels some pixels from the top and nothing from the side.

124
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,430
OK.

125
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,570
So of course we just can't see the color and the padding.

126
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,590
But that is OK.

127
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,830
Now inside of this so we can put things inside we need to use this toolbar.

128
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,560
So inside of the toolbar we can put buttons icons and other things.

129
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,140
So we need to make a reference to toolbar.

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,660
So again toolbar open and close.

131
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:47,200
Now inside of toolbar we will get to thinks the header I'm sorry the logo and then of course later we

132
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
can add the button.

133
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,480
So the first thing is going to be adding the logo.

134
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,880
And remember that I gave you the CSSA and we are not going to do CSSA.

135
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,270
So I'm just going to write a component in this case is going to be just a div and I'm going to be adding

136
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,930
just a class name and make sure you're typing the same name the class name is me.

137
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,050
Because if you're not type in the same class as me of course the application will not find that class

138
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,090
on the resources and styles around.

139
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,640
So in this case you can do whatever you want.

140
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,030
If you make you change it right here you want it to go and change it on the styles.

141
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,320
That's the essence.

142
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,660
All right.

143
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,760
So head on Logo.

144
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,780
That's it.

145
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,990
Now I'm going to go right here and say Dave and I are going to be adding the venue.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,530
We have two lines right here.

147
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,680
The venue with a different kind of font and then musical events with a different you know type of font

148
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,570
or you know different size and everything else.

149
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,200
So going to create two dips first one with a class name.

150
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,420
Going to leave it empty and then are going to create in pretty much the same thing.

151
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,830
So I'm going to copy this one and paste it at the bottom.

152
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,720
So the class name we're going to use something that calls font and righteous something like this.

153
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,940
And this is a font that we need to install from.

154
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,630
From Google fonts so it's all right.

155
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:16,950
And then just like this and then hetter logo Benue and then the text for this one is going to be the

156
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,690
venue.

157
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,450
All right.

158
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,810
And with a capital B There you go.

159
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:30,810
Now the other one is going to be Hetter logo and then title and musical events when they make it on

160
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,200
the right spot.

161
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,030
The call.

162
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,710
There we go.

163
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,620
Sorry for that.

164
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,770
Musical events.

165
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,960
OK.

166
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,180
So if I of course really love this we kind of get something but the font it's you know something else.

167
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,100
And this is because we don't have the font on our project so I'm going to go open a new tab.

168
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,680
I'm going to say Google fonts and inside Google fonts We will search the font that we eat in this case

169
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,710
it's going to be righteous and I'm going to click the plus button and we're going to use another one.

170
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,220
It's called robo dough.

171
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:18,140
You know very very popular so on the font family are going to go to customize light for Roboto and then

172
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,780
medium and the other one is the only one we get which is regular and then are just going to copy this

173
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,580
go to the public directory index and paste it just like a regular font.

174
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,370
And of course the app will reload and we get you know the venue and musical events.

175
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,460
So the next step would be adding the combine and said let's go to the next section and add the button.

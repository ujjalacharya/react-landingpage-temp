1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,900
All right so now we're going to be creating this transparency effect we get.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,670
So when whenever the page loads and the head are it's on the top we want a transparent background not

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,690
a black.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,760
So I'm going to create a new state right here and I'm going to say I don't know.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,830
Hetter show some like that at her show and at the beginning whenever the page loads it's going to be

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,540
false.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,020
OK.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,720
So now right here instead of just hard coding the color I could ask the application for head or Joe

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,360
show.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,260
It's false.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,540
So if it's false We're going to show Transparent.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,630
But if it's true we can show a color.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,250
OK.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,850
So it's going to be this dot state DOT show drawer.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,930
Sorry had her show and I'm going to use a ternary.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,120
So if it is true we can it show this color.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,780
But if it's not we're going to do transparent.

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,170
Just like this transparent the application right now loads.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,150
And this is false.

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,380
So it's going to go to this scenario.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,230
So if I go to our application the application starts and we have a transparent color.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,330
So now whenever we scroll we need to ask the application OK the user scrolled from the top.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,710
Yeah.

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:18,990
OK.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,070
Just change the color so we're going to do it through state.

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,990
Because whenever we change the states the application we renders and this state is going to be true.

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,750
So it's going to go to this scenario instead of this one.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,030
Let me remove it.

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,850
There you go.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,770
So what can we do.

31
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:42,720
So on the component did mount attached to the window an event listener and this listener is going to

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,210
listen for this cruel event.

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:51,330
No this is just a vanilla javascript not not react so at event just like this.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,560
Sorry.

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,430
Let me do something else I forgot to do something.

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,890
I'm going to first go to the component mount so component at Mt..

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,490
Open and Close.

38
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,090
Now I'm going to make a reference to window Dodd then at event listener opening Krogh close and the

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,050
listener is going to be scroll and remember again this is vanilla Javascript.

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,450
So whenever you use a scroll to run a function.

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,510
So I'm going to say this that handle scroll we didn't we didn't have this function we can create it

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,210
right now.

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,250
This hander's call.

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,930
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and create the function handle scroll.

45
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,160
Open and Close.

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,470
Let me just do it like this.

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,930
There's no difference anyways.

48
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,310
In this case because we are using a class.

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:47,600
So right you're just going to do console log user scrolling or something like that user.

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,320
Let me make it right.

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,830
All right.

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,180
So whenever the application loads the application after its mount it bounces.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
It will add and even listener office scroll to our components.

54
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,960
So if I scroll I run we run our function.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,610
This one handles Krull.

56
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:13,260
So on this one what we can do we can check the window scroll position and if it's greater than zero

57
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,590
then you know we don't show the caller but if it's greater than zero it means that the user scrolled

58
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,830
from the top.

59
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,160
So we changed a color.

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,800
All right.

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:30,140
So I got to into this for now I'm going to say F just a good old F and then of course an else.

62
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,130
So right here I get to be checking the window dot scroll and the why.

63
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,120
Because we only need to check the y axis not the horizontal axis.

64
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,520
So if this one it's greater than zero right we will do something.

65
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,230
If not we will do something else.

66
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,610
So what do we do we toggle the state of Hetter show.

67
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:01,830
So I'm going to say this that set stayed open and close and the draw were show for this one is going

68
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,060
to be true because it's greater than zero so we want to show the color.

69
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,660
And if it's not we're going to say false.

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,630
Right.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,880
So false.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,750
So if I were the application we and you know the application loads and you know this crawl is try here.

73
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,260
So we get the caliber you scroll up you know we are at the top.

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,570
So it goes to the Falls condition to the outs so we don't get the car.

75
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,070
And if we scroll down we get it.

76
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,230
And if not we don't get it.

77
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,180
So that you know the recall.

78
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,250
So this one works OK because this is a single page it's a landing page.

79
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,210
So we don't have a route because maybe if you're doing and you're adding an event listener on this page

80
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,360
and maybe on don't know and your application you have a different route where you didn't use this effect

81
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,510
would be a good idea to remove the add even listener instead of at it's going to be removed event listener

82
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,750
and you're going to be doing this on the component will unmount.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,890
Always remember to remove the event listeners whenever you go to a different component where you're

84
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,650
not really using this.

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,260
OK.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,990
So goes so everything works as expected for now.

87
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,530
All right so now we're going to be creating the you know the slider and the countdown on this one.

88
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,410
I made a mistake.

89
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,440
Let me just give me a second let me just fix it one second.

90
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,950
So this site you're sorry the event starts and this is the final one.

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:41,110
But I did this this project you know a few weeks ago and I have a date right here we calculate the date

92
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,690
and let me just give me one second let me find this one right here.

93
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,680
OK.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,290
I modified this on the original you know file on the original project.

95
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,600
So the end starts in what does.

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,540
We pass a date in this case is going to be December 16th of this year.

97
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:06,320
So we have one 166 days and what it does it's going to calculate how many days minutes hours and seconds

98
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,860
until you know the event starts.

99
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,110
So this is what we're going to be doing.

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,430
And whenever the the application loads we'll use the transition and we will do this you know this slide

101
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
or this carousel.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,430
OK.

103
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,820
So let's go to the next section and we'll start with the carousel and then with the the event starts

104
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,790
in and I'm going to skip this version of the project with all of this I'm going to upload it to this

105
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,540
section so you can get the code we have so far.

1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,960
OK so let's create this component.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,710
So we have a few things we are going to be adding a transition whenever the comput and LOTES and all

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,800
this logic.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,420
But first we're going to create this component and you know some dumb some with some hard coded numbers.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,000
OK.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,730
So first we need a component where are we going to be hosting this so inside a feature I'm going to

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,760
call it time until could call.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,640
You could call it countdown or something like that it doesn't matter.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,330
So of course I need to import it from here.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,540
So import.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:48,360
I called it time until from 4:00 slash time until I get and I'm going to make a reference to this at

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,640
the bottom of this.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,070
Or at time time until there we go.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,420
Sorry for that.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,280
So inside time until it's going to be real simple it's a class based component because we will have

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,340
a state that will manage all the numbers all the logic right here.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,350
So I'm going to create a react class based component.

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,090
OK.

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:19,020
So there you go and it's going to be called time until we will have a state of something we will be

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,600
completing this later.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,830
First we're going to create this you know the the layout for this.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,420
So at the bottom are going to go right here to the render and the class name which is the container

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:40,040
of this section is going to be called Count down underscore and then wrap her count down.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,840
All right count on wrapper and I'm going to call the and copy the keyword count down because we're going

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
to use it a lot.

26
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,880
So inside of here we have two different sections.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,090
This event starts in and then you know the bottom part.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,670
OK.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,120
So first I'm going to create a div and the class name for this is going to be counted down underscore

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,570
and then top.

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,790
And this when it's going to say event starts in.

32
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,680
And if we check it you know we can it get it.

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,460
OK.

34
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,160
So then we have the bottom part of this which is you know a container.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,600
We can create a div with a class name off of course the opposite of the other one which is bottom.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,970
So inside of here we have four different items.

37
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,210
You have this one which is the one with the days the hours the minute and the seconds.

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,030
So we need four different dips with different values.

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,620
So it's kind of a template.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,790
It's always the same one.

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,010
So I'm going to create a div with a class name of Countdown underscore item.

42
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,480
Now instead of here we have two different things.

43
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,960
We have the number and we have days or hours or minutes or seconds.

44
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,720
So I'm going to create a div with a class name.

45
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,540
There we go.

46
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,180
Class name.

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,850
And it's going to be Count town town and time sort of here in this case will be the days.

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,460
So I'm going to put them to 23 and then at the bottom I'm going to say div opening close.

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,560
And this one is going to be called two days and they're going to be adding a class to this one as well.

50
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,780
So class name and I call that countdown task.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,070
All right.

52
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,320
So overload we have 23 days.

53
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,450
So we pretty much we need to repeat all of this and again we could create a function to loop all of

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,660
this but we will only to create an array with no different strings and everything else.

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,140
There's no need to do that.

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,650
So this one is going to be I don't know two and there's one.

57
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:52,690
It's ours going to copy and then paste it at the bottom and the next one is going to be 20 and then

58
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,960
minute.

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,240
So something like this.

60
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,700
Let me make this capital H.

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,530
Yes.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,070
All right.

63
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,850
I'm going to copy this one in it's the last one and it copy paste and this one is going to be the seconds

64
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,840
and I don't know 40.

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,010
OK.

66
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,390
Can I reload it.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,640
And we get it right.

68
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,090
So everything's good.

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,640
So now if you notice on the original one whenever we reload we are getting this transition.

70
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:27,470
So this transition comes from a third party library called re-act revealed.

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,140
Let me find it right here.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Re-act reveal and then get have

73
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,990
so there go re-act reveal.

74
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,820
So this is the get have of react with Bill.

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,650
It's really really simple to use and it's really really great.

76
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,320
So we have a number of different type of effects for different components Faid flip rotate bounce and

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,050
roll.

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,760
So you can check the documentation's.

79
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,660
You even have examples so if I go to one example you can get it right here with an example code with

80
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,130
what you need to import and what you need to use to fade it.

81
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:14,640
You know to the left and same thing for the ride top or bottom and you can even rotate and you can bounce

82
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,560
roll you know really really really simple to use.

83
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,860
So we're going to use this one and I'm going to be using the gate effect right now.

84
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,810
So I'm going to go at the top and since we have this re-active installed we have it right here and we

85
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,750
find it re-act reveal we can use it.

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:43,380
So inside instead of the time until I going to import then slide from oh sorry I'm using slide this

87
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,700
one slide and slide it from left to right.

88
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,340
OK.

89
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,940
So the slide from then react then reveal four slash.

90
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,750
And we need to bring it just like material.

91
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,050
So we agree with you.

92
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,570
OK.

93
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,540
There's no way to do this.

94
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,550
I just you know used to do this to put this in my column.

95
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,360
So now how can we use it.

96
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,450
Real simple.

97
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,310
We need to wrap whatever component whatever div or container we want to animate within this.

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,740
No this component does slide component.

99
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,820
So I'm going to create a slight opening close and I'm going to chop everything from here and I'm going

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:27,210
to paste it inside of a slide going to select all and then format selection you know just to make it

101
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,080
nice.

102
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,910
Now this slide meets to know where from where is going to be sliding from left or right or everything.

103
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,570
By default I believe it's left.

104
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,950
But anyways I just left.

105
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,750
All right.

106
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,790
So of course you have a lot of other properties inside the documentation.

107
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:52,080
You can use props right here customize the SS or component props so you can select a duration delay

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,620
which means how long it's going to wait after these component appears to you know create the transition

109
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,260
or the animation.

110
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,610
So you know left right we really know about this one.

111
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,090
What.

112
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,900
What else.

113
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,100
You have the distance.

114
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,890
What else.

115
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,180
The time out.

116
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,700
The mount on enter.

117
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,470
Maybe you can unmount an exit.

118
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,680
You can destroy that whenever the components goes out.

119
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,650
And again you have a lot of options.

120
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,190
No.

121
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:20,950
OK.

122
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,800
So let's go back right here.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,950
And I want to slide to the left but I don't want to slide at this as soon as the page renders.

124
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,370
I want to wait a little bit before it shows.

125
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,410
So I'm going to use a delay property.

126
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,190
So the lay equals opening close.

127
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,040
They're going to wait one second after the component it's completely rendered.

128
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,580
So there you go.

129
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,710
Let me reload it.

130
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,520
All right.

131
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,060
You know looks nice.

132
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,800
OK.

133
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,760
So what is it.

134
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,520
So now what we need to do we need to read all the logic to populate the numbers right here.

135
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,800
So let's go to the next section and do this.

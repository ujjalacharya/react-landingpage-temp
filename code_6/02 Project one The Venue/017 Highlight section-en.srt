1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,290
All right.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,950
So let's do the highlights.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,470
So when are you of course girl.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,450
We have highlights this gets animated.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,640
And this is one component and then we have the other component which is going to be animating the number

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,780
right here.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,810
And then of course we have a different part where are we going to be sliding towards left.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,410
All right.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,510
Well let's start reading this.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,490
Going to go back to our project and inside of our project I'm going to create a new directory where

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,240
we're going to be hosting the files and I'm going to call it highlights again.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,580
Call this whatever you want.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:43,080
So inside highlights I will have an index that is and this index that Diaz of course will be will be

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,420
rendering the components inside of here.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,160
OK.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,610
So I'm going to create a re-act stateless components and I'm going to call this highlights.

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,320
All right.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:04,320
So inside of here I can add a class name for the wrapper and it can be called high lights and then highlight

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,320
wrapper.

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,580
All right.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,090
So instead of here going to create two different components one for the description which is the first

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,050
thing we're going to do.

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,000
And then you know for the actual discount.

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,870
So OK so we don't have this component.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm going to go right here and create a new file and I'm going to call it description.

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,160
This is the first one we're going to be creating.

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,830
So the description is really simple.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,620
So we just need a yakked stateless component.

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,540
And I made a mistake called the descriptions and it's description and the fix it right now.

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,100
All right.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,300
So instead of description's is going to be description.

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,340
So on this one we're going to reveal this this that top part with a fade transition.

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:02:00,960
So straight ahead I'm just going to import fade fade from re-act reveal for Slash.

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,000
And then of course fate.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,800
All right now the.

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,350
Right here on their return since we need to wrap everything inside of a fade.

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:20,980
I'm just going to say fate and the content is going to be a Dave with a class name of center wrapper.

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,630
The title is going to be in H-2 and I'm going to call the highlights.

39
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,150
There you go.

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,220
Highlights.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:36,240
And then of course the text is going to be inside of a div with the class name of highlights or highlight

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,320
description as a recession.

43
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,890
And of course I'm going to copy some lorem ipsum.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,570
You can go to law ipsum and copy some dumb some text.

45
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,980
So I'm going to save it.

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,150
And of course if you reload the application we are not getting anything because I'm not including the

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,000
highlight index and I'm not bringing that description here.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,580
All right.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,150
We're going to do that right now.

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,300
So first we need to import it so import.

51
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,120
And notice how how easy was this.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:19,870
You know to add the transmission so import this corruption from open forces close description.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,500
All right.

54
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,390
And then I make a reference to the description component right here inside.

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,540
And then of course on the app we need to bring the highlights component on the app.

56
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:44,420
So import highlight from dot dot for Slash components for Slash highlights could be highlight instead

57
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,950
of highlights and that's fine.

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,350
And then of course since we want to bring the index there is no need to make reference to that.

59
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,920
And then instead of here opening close.

60
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,570
All right we'll see what happens next.

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,890
You know it's fine.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,490
So I scroll down and we get the fate of highlights and notice that right now the via's code.

63
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:11,240
It's kind of a boring is doing a great out on this components be a code.

64
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,090
Actually it has.

65
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,950
It has a few bucks.

66
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,360
I've updated the operation and it fails by fails doing this.

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,230
So I don't know what it is have never read and of course we have it right here.

68
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,430
But you know if I close it and open it let me do this.

69
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,630
Well sometimes it clears the air.

70
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,270
I don't know what the obvious code or mismatch error.

71
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,590
Right is a bug.

72
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,240
All right so let's do the second part of the highlights.

73
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,240
So I'm going to go to highlights.

74
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,600
Create a new file and this one is going to be called Discount dot J Yes.

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,740
So this discount is not going to be that simple.

76
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,410
We're going to do a few things right here.

77
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,690
So I'm going to create a re-act class based component and called discount.

78
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,560
All right.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,320
And we use a phase transition and a slight transition from Briac we veal.

80
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:12,160
So I will do import fade from re-act reveal again and then we can get a B calling it.

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,810
We can call the same thing fade and we do the same same thing with a slide.

82
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,200
So Slide copy and paste slide bigot.

83
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,170
OK.

84
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,730
So now if we take a look at the final one we have two different parts the left and the right.

85
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:38,920
So instead of here I'm going to say div add a class name off and center wrapper.

86
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,110
These are you know the wrapper classes instead of here are going to wrap everything inside of a class

87
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,650
name of a discount wrapper.

88
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,330
All right.

89
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,830
So pretty much this one is the one that is adding the color.

90
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,930
You know and this one is one that it's centering everything doesn't matter.

91
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,750
OK.

92
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,260
So instead of here we have two different sides.

93
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,520
We have the left side which is going to be a div with a class name of discount.

94
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,460
We always use pretty much the same thing.

95
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:18,380
And then poor centage percentage we get.

96
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,120
So me just copy the discount so I didn't have to type it.

97
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,310
And then inside of here we have two pens.

98
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,940
So going to say is pen.

99
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,760
And then another is Pam.

100
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,850
Now the original has the spine and top with the number.

101
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,830
And this one at the bottom.

102
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,130
So the first one will have the number and we will be getting the number from state.

103
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,920
And then we will be adding the percentage something like that we find a percentage that we go.

104
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,660
All right.

105
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,310
And the other one is going to say chest off.

106
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:56,130
So if I reload the application of course we need to include it sorry for that.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,020
Imported.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:05,930
So I'm going to go I'm going to the index of highlights and in port we call it discount.

109
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,170
There's count from four slash and discount.

110
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,670
Sorry for that I forgot to do this happens sometimes.

111
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,420
So inside discount we should be getting that.

112
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,090
Twenty three percent.

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,960
And then the off of course we're going to be animating element this and we're going to do it through

114
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,850
state.

115
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,160
You know we could do it with just with javascript but begin to do it through state or not.

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,810
So the next component they want in the right is going to be just active and with a class name of this

117
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,710
count with not a capital D discount.

118
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,130
And then this question.

119
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,280
All right.

120
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,500
And on top we have an H3 and I know this is the boring part.

121
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,040
We are almost done and we can focus more on Javascript.

122
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,580
So the title is purchase tickets before.

123
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,230
Again this is just practice you can type whenever you want.

124
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,300
Doesn't matter.

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,250
So then we have a paragraph and again I'm going to copy these.

126
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,510
Lauren ipsum then have a p.

127
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,800
And then we have a button right here we have this button.

128
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,190
But later in the application we will have the same button.

129
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,740
So it makes no sense for us to copy to create a button right here and this component and then do the

130
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,650
same code right here.

131
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,390
So we're going to be creating reusable component for this but we're going to do.

132
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,860
We're going to leave this to the last.

133
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,550
All right.

134
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:42,190
So after this you know after these discount description I'm sorry after the paragraph we're going to

135
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,220
go make some space after the paragraph.

136
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,880
Well adding a day of just a div with Button.

137
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,830
We know that the button goes though it goes there.

138
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,800
So if I scroll down everything looks nice.

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,970
So now let's add the transitions first because it's the easy part.

140
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,750
So I'm going to go right here.

141
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:07,150
I'm going to bring Faid opening close and I'm going to put everything inside by default live it's left

142
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,020
then we're going to be adding slide on the other components.

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,540
So I'm going to put slide chop everything put it inside.

144
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,590
And then of course I can say I want our right transition so OK.

145
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,980
We had we kept the fate.

146
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,350
And then we get the right.

147
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,100
So you know looks looks nice.

148
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,620
So now what we need to do I need to animate this number and we can do this through state not just maybe

149
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,400
Javascript.

150
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,690
So I'm going to go right here and create a state state.

151
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,350
Equals opening close and I need to say when does this count starts.

152
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,980
And when the discount is going to end you know it's going to animate from zero to I don't know 30 percent.

153
00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:01,160
So the first stage is going to be this count and then start and it starts at zero then pretty much the

154
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,830
same thing but it's going to say discount and it's going to start up and so it's going to stop at 30.

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,220
So when I want to do.

156
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,940
And if you notice whenever the application loads this Faid transmission's takes some time.

157
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,710
This transition of the fade takes time.

158
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:27,650
So what happens if it triggers the animation of the zero to 30 when the component starts and not when

159
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,110
this you know this component this part of code starts fading in.

160
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,480
So where are the tablets.

161
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,320
You know try to simulate this.

162
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,490
If I reload the application this of course will trigger and it will start.

163
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,340
Does this count.

164
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,340
You know that animation with a number and by the time we reached this part we've already have the authority

165
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,550
you know makes no sense.

166
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,340
So what we need to do we need a way to trigger that animation that function only when we have the component

167
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,230
rebuild already.

168
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,690
So again just like before the library it's really really good.

169
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,740
They give us a call back.

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,030
So after everything it's revealed or this component this element gets revealed we can run a callback

171
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,730
function.

172
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,620
And there's this calls on reveal just like this.

173
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,400
So on reveal we can trigger whatever function we want.

174
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:27,000
So we can to just trigger a function called this percentage again call this whatever you want percentage.

175
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,270
No port centage.

176
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,080
All right.

177
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,770
So we didn't have this function going to go right here.

178
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,420
Again to say percentage open and close.

179
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,720
So the main This function is going to do me make it like this.

180
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,480
What this function is going to do is going to check is going to check if that didn't this count start

181
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,710
equal to the discount end and we're going to be updating that discount start and this is what we're

182
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,230
going to be rendering right here.

183
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,520
This is what we're going to be doing.

184
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,110
And seems like I to another this percentage it's because I never saved it.

185
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,810
Now if you save it you go.

186
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,340
So what I can do I'm going to go right here am I going to show you with code simpler.

187
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,210
So first we're going to check if the discounts start it's greater than the discount end.

188
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,020
If it's not an update to state with this count start plus one.

189
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,050
Pretty simple.

190
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:32,450
So OK so I'm going to say this that state that this count start it's less than this that state that

191
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,400
this count and all right.

192
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,850
And if it's of course if this condition goes through we're going to go right here and said the state

193
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,740
of the new value on this count start.

194
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:51,480
So this can start equals this state that this can start plus one.

195
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,130
All right.

196
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,680
I could do this a lot smaller but I'm going slow on the first project and I'm going just easy.

197
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:05,540
So of course whenever the Faid gets real that the element gets revealed we will run the function the

198
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,510
function will go true because zero it's not greater than 30 and we will be updating the states with

199
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:11,810
one.

200
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,490
So on the next render discounts start it's going to be equal to one.

201
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,450
All right.

202
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,680
So I'm going to save this and I'm going to go right here.

203
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:29,230
I'm going to say this that oops that state discount sorry discount start.

204
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,580
So we should be getting zero in after the render.

205
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,840
We're going to be counting of course we're going to be getting one because we are adding one to the

206
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,820
mix.

207
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,640
So if I go Faid we have one.

208
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,450
And I'm going to add the percentage.

209
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,880
So help page reloads we get the fade in and we do the callback and we are just getting one.

210
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:00,020
But the thing is that we need to get 30 so we need to run this function right as many times we need

211
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,560
to reach the number 30.

212
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,850
And of course when we do this when we do said state when we said state we're updating the state.

213
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:19,010
So the application gets re rendered or gets updated so we can grab the component that update and run

214
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,760
this function again if we actually we really need to so.

215
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:31,960
So it's going to be set at a set time out because I need to kind of wait a little bit of time before

216
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,580
we can update the number so we can you know see the transition.

217
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,260
So it's going to be really small.

218
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,530
I'm going to show you why in a second.

219
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,980
So if I do this that percentage whenever the component APS-C updates the first time we're going to run

220
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,550
it again.

221
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,120
Now it's going to be two then we're going to run it again.

222
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,850
It's going to be three four and five and so we'll reach 30 and we are not updating the state any more

223
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,530
so this component did update will not run any more.

224
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:09,100
So I'm going to save it reload the application and get it now this Thursday it's the amount of time

225
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:15,370
the flow from that that's going to take for the animation from number two number would actually not

226
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,020
an animation.

227
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,610
But you know looks like an animation.

228
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,190
So if I put 300.

229
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,220
The transition is going to be real slow.

230
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,280
Look.

231
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,310
That is it.

232
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,080
That's why.

233
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,070
So that's why we use third and that is it.

234
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,170
So this component it's pretty much done.

235
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,660
So the next one is going to be the pricing.

236
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,450
And this one we have a few interesting things.

237
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,620
But before we start doing this are going to do the buttons and this button we will be using this on

238
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,030
this one.

239
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,270
So we will create every usable component with the button right here.

240
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,550
So let's go to the next section and just do that.

1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,570
Right.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:06,280
So we're going to build the next component which is the pricing component.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,330
So OK so I'm going to.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,410
This is the final one.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,590
You know the local host 3 0 0 2.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,060
And if I reload the application we get this transition.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,250
So first we get the one in the middle and then we get the other two.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,760
So this is what we're going to be doing is going to be really really simple right.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,460
So first when I'm going to do to close everything right here because I have a lot of files open I don't

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,450
really want that.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,080
So the first one is the app that I guess which is you know we are going to require import the next component

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,230
and this one is going to be the prizing so I'm going to go to components create a new directory called

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,240
prising makes sense.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,980
Prising up message.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,690
So an inside prizing of course we just need one file.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,140
I'm not going to divide this on maybe two different places.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,110
So prizing and it's going to be Index index that Jap's.

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,910
Right.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,690
OK.

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,210
So this one is going to be a class based component.

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:11,290
I'm going to feed the boxes from the state so re-act class based component and instead of index this

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,330
one is going to be prizing.

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:13,950
All right.

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,790
Going to change the name.

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:24,080
Now I'm going to go to abdicates and include this imported import prizing from.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,140
And same thing DOD for Slash components than for Slash and pricing.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,610
Oregon says we have an index.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,570
There's no need to put in x.

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,750
And then of course I will include it right here.

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,650
Now we're going to go back to our project and of course we get nothing because we pretty much have nothing.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,430
OK.

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,650
So first are going to be adding you know the structure for this the container def is going to be a class

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,170
name of B C K and then black.

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,760
Remember we've already used this rather than inside.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,850
We will have a div just like this.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:09,680
And with the class name off and I'm going to use the center wrapper we use before center and then wrapper.

37
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,540
And this one is going to be the prising section.

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,770
All right.

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,660
So on top we get an age to tag with the prising prizing.

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,780
And then of course we get the you know the container that will contain the three boxes.

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,230
So I'm going to say Dev and the class name for this one is going to be prising wrapper prizing and then

42
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,510
wrapper.

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,410
All right.

44
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,210
And of course right here we get the boxes.

45
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:43,530
So if I reload the application we get prizing and then we get boxes so we are on track.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,720
So right here when I want to do I want to run a function trigger function whenever the component renders

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,080
and that get from state whatever is that we need to output to show.

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,620
OK.

49
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,050
So first to do this before calling the function we need to state where we can get the information.

50
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,490
So I'm going to say state open and close and we will have several things we have the price.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,300
You know the category the description and the link where is where this is going to go.

52
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,990
So OK so first I'm going to start with prizing.

53
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,710
So I'm going to say prices prices and since we have three and we need to loop an array I'm going to

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,910
just loop this charade prizes.

55
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,350
So the first box is going to be 100.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,220
The second one is going to be 150.

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,970
And the last one is going to be to 50.

58
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,410
You know this one is the expensive one.

59
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,040
Then we have the positions you know balcony medium star whatever.

60
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,380
So positions you can call again this you can call this whenever you want.

61
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,420
So the first one is balcony.

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:54,040
The second one I call that medium and the next one is going to be you know the star just in front of

63
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,890
the time.

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,800
Then we have the scription and for this one for now it's going to be an array.

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,500
We three lines of descriptions so you can do this.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,580
You can put whatever you want inside.

67
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,640
I got a copy of some I have right here.

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,430
You can go to learn tips and you know get the text from there that doesn't matter.

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,790
So I'm going to put koma going to go to the next line.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,540
Let me get this one.

71
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm going to copy the other one.

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,830
So if there's been you know it's when I I need to do it again at your home you can skip this and the

73
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,340
next one is going to be the last line.

74
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,580
LMC I got a mistake.

75
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,580
See why this is why forget coma.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,320
And that's it.

77
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,520
We have the description coma description.

78
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,070
OK.

79
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,110
And then of course we have the link.

80
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,270
So I'm going to put a coma on this and then link to I'm going to call that link to.

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,040
And again we we've got an array.

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:02,940
So the first one is I know it's GTP call for Slash and then don't know sales forward slash B for balcony

83
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,910
and then pretty much we do the same thing.

84
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,360
You can put whatever you want right here.

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Now on this Web sites most of times when they you know you have you create a page on the page where

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,050
they sell something.

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,410
Most of the times the link will take will take the user to a different place where they can complete

88
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,160
the purchase.

89
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,040
That's the way it works.

90
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,510
So I'm going to do the same thing so this one is going to be.

91
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,420
There's one is going to be this for medium and the other one is going to be star.

92
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,520
Everything is in order.

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,450
Right.

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,500
The first one its balcony the first always the same position on the right.

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,650
So this one is done.

96
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,280
So right now we have the stage so we can loop this and generate the content right right here right.

97
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,360
So we can add it.

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,620
So I'm going to create a function called show Buxus.

99
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:58,730
So it's going to be show and then Buxus it's going to be equal to a function and that function will

100
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,670
return some GSX.

101
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:08,210
That's why I'm using the parentheses and not this whenever we use parentheses we can return some div

102
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,150
and that will be rendered whenever we call the function.

103
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,270
For example if I put.

104
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,050
And now I go right here and make call to this that shoeboxes.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,310
And you know the function I'm going to reload the application and begin to get.

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,150
Hello.

107
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,920
All right.

108
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,960
And there's no need to do this.

109
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:36,210
If we do a bracket just like this one will not work and all top this is not going to work.

110
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,900
We need to do a return and do this and put to death inside.

111
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,710
I'm telling you this because maybe you didn't know you know and you're wondering why are you using brackets

112
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,480
or parentheses instead of brackets.

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,250
So that's fine.

114
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,360
But in this case we can use the premises.

115
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,950
All right.

116
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,450
So now what do we need to do.

117
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,090
We need to loop at least the prices because we have always three positions on each array.

118
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,230
So we can loop this and then get all the other positions with the iteration number right.

119
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,830
So with the index number.

120
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,430
So for now I'm going to do this.

121
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,210
I don't need it.

122
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,020
So I'm going to say this that state that they're going to use prizes.

123
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,500
That map going to loop over it.

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,460
And in each iteration I'm going to be passing something and running something again since we want to

125
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:29,050
return some GSX from this map if we use brackets this one will not work if we use parenthesis it will

126
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,540
return some GSX.

127
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,610
So if I do dev and now right here are going to say a box makes sense.

128
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,860
And then the iteration.

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,200
So the box is going to be each item on each iteration.

130
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,510
The first iteration which is the one the first is going to be 100.

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,520
Balcony the first description and the first link.

132
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,690
So the first div which is the container will have a class name of prizing and then item right.

133
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,880
Prising item.

134
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,280
Then inside of here we get a different wrapper.

135
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,080
Which class can it be.

136
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,860
Prising per izing enter.

137
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,550
And then we leave it.

138
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,650
I call that rubber and I'm going to call.

139
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm going to copy the prizing keyboard and look at instead of here we have pretty much three different

140
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,830
things.

141
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,560
We have the title which is that the top part actually.

142
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,550
Then the description and then the button.

143
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:23,930
OK.

144
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:31,980
So the first day of going to college and the class name is going to be prising underscore title.

145
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,210
And of course right here we're going to get the title.

146
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,740
All right the next one is going to be the description.

147
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,910
So I'm going to do Dave create just a div with the class name of prizing.

148
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:53,920
And of course the scription and right here we're going to get the description or whatever.

149
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,600
OK.

150
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,780
So then Dave and the next one the class name and prising buttons.

151
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,130
So prizing and then buttons and right here we get a button at the bottom.

152
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,520
So in theory I reload this we should be getting three different boxes and we do title this kitchen and

153
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,300
then button.

154
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,890
OK.

155
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,820
So seems we are looping something we can get the values from the loop.

156
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,820
The price we can get it from the box or we can call this state the price and then the number of the

157
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,530
iteration.

158
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,840
We can do that.

159
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,800
So for the title we can get two different pens.

160
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,950
So the first pen it's the actual prize.

161
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,830
So again a dollar sign or currency sign.

162
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,510
And I could use box or I could use this that state the price to use.

163
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,900
Does that state that prizes.

164
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,840
And then of course the position of the iteration and it's going to be of course 0 1 and 2.

165
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,000
So we get 1 100 and 200.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,220
So that is good.

167
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,140
So next one is going to be next the next responder which is the position.

168
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,020
So we do the same the same thing.

169
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:07,870
There's that state that positions and again the iteration number the net and the next one is going to

170
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,450
be the description.

171
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,690
So there's that state that the desk called the desk and then the iteration number.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,580
All right all right that is good.

173
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,420
So next one is going to be the Bunin if you remember we have a component a reusable component.

174
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:32,090
So what we can do we can include the component at the top and make use of it.

175
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:42,520
So it's going to be import my button from that dot for Slash us that's why we have you Telles.

176
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,860
And then my button.

177
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,490
All right.

178
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,930
So now I'm going to go at the bottom and instead of this are going to be passing the button.

179
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,440
Right.

180
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
So OK.

181
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,950
Let me make it right my button.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,280
And instead of my brain I could make this a you know self closing.

183
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,150
Right.

184
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,270
So if you remember we need to pass some configurations.

185
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,840
So first it's a text we need to add.

186
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,780
In this case I'm going to say I don't know just something simple.

187
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:19,130
The next one is going to be the background color so B C K and B are the property for this same yellow

188
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,150
f a 8 zero zero.

189
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,290
The next one is going to be the color of the text which in this case it's going to be white because

190
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,880
it makes sense.

191
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,160
And the next one I don't remember the name I believe was called a link.

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,910
Yes.

193
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,640
Like.

194
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,710
All right it's going to go back and the link is going to be.

195
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,450
And if you remember we have the link right here.

196
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:51,500
So the property for this is going to be this that state that link or actually link to and then of course

197
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,890
the iteration.

198
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,150
All right.

199
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,170
And so we get it.

200
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:02,260
So if I open this sales B and the next one is going to be I really am.

201
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,960
And that works.

202
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,680
Everything works.

203
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,890
So now the thing is that if we take a look at the original let me just reload the application.

204
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,020
We have a transition and first the one that it's appearing at first.

205
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,090
It's the middle one.

206
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
It's going to be this one.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,180
So we cannot add a transition in order.

208
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,900
What we need to do is to do something else so how can we do this.

209
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,430
How can we make this for the second one appear first and then the other ones.

210
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,750
All right if you want to do it on your own you can you can do it no problem.

211
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,490
I'm going to show you now I'm going to use a state so I can store it inside of the state a delay.

212
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:42,910
Right.

213
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,470
Because it makes sense.

214
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,740
So OK so I'm going to say delay.

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,250
So the first iteration on the delay is going to be 500.

216
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,440
So the first element before you to Pierce is going to wait a half second.

217
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,950
Now the middle one needs to appear first.

218
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,240
So there's one it's zero.

219
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,710
It's just going to show.

220
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,110
Right.

221
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,880
Right away.

222
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,910
And the third one is going to show with the first one.

223
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,740
OK.

224
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,890
So now we need to use that transition from re-act reveal.

225
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,700
So I'm going to go right here.

226
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,560
Import soome from.

227
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:26,350
And then of course re-act reveal four slash and then the name of what we are bringing in right here

228
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,200
which is suit.

229
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,610
All right.

230
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,180
So now what do we need to do.

231
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,810
We need to wrap this component and instead of returning just a div we need to return.

232
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,590
Assume component.

233
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,290
OK.

234
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:44,950
I'm going to copy paste it.

235
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,660
And there we go.

236
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,300
So now this soon needs some configuration.

237
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,980
First we will need a key.

238
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:59,240
Remember that when we act whenever we loop something we need to add a key so key open and close and

239
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,730
the key could be the iteration number.

240
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,750
And then of course we need to add delay.

241
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,410
So delay opening close.

242
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,550
And is this that state that delay and iteration number.

243
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,140
Right.

244
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,650
So let me reload the application and we get it and we try again.

245
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,190
OK so let's get this done.

246
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,120
So let's move forward to the next component which is going to be real simple.

247
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,680
It's going to be the I believe it's going to be the the the location one.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,160
So we're going to do that right now.

1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,050
All right so now our project is finished.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:11,490
So we need to put it inside of production or host the project some place so we can to use search for

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,200
the yes.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,210
For the first proper project because this is you know a static web project.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,770
You know we don't have a no day as going in the background we didn't have a server we didn't have anything

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,210
after we create a building.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,280
This is just some L with some J.S. so search it's really really simple simple to use.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,180
And if of course you want to use greater features the prising.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,700
It's really small.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,660
So if you're a front end developer there's no need to go to Heroku or go to Amazon do you.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,140
The only thing you need to do is search.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,320
You just push and it's really simple to push the project into production.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,380
Really really simple.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,930
I can assure you right now.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:01:00,090
So I going to go to the terminal our terminal you know and I'm going to come and this are going to clear

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,690
now the venue is inside the venue.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,520
Inside our project now what we push to search is search is going to be our build.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,660
You know the build of this project not all the directories with sores and everything else.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,120
So we push a modified version of our project.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,010
So if you go to Pakistan Jason and we go to scripts we have right here the built so we can run NPM run

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,410
build or Yorn run build and it will create a bundle for production.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,340
So I'm going to go right here and I'm using yarned remember.

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,040
So I'm going to say yarn run built and of course if you're using NPM it's an end run built.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,140
So I'm going to press Enter.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,590
This is going to take a couple minutes and I'll be right back.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,740
OK.

27
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,760
Everything was done.

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,600
So now what we need to do is to install search so we can you know upload the project to build directory

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,010
we need to upload this one.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,930
Not everything else just built into Sorge.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,480
So if we go to help Of course we get all the instructions of how to do it and it's real simple.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm going to show you right now.

33
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,070
First we need to install first which you installed search in our computer we install it globally.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,600
So I'm going to say clear right now and I'm going to do.

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,890
And of course if you're using NPM you need to do and PM install mine is because we installed globally

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,280
and then search.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,370
This is what you need to do in my case.

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,270
I'm using Joern.

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,400
So it's yarn global.

40
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,370
And then of course search just like this.

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,910
So I'm going to present or will already have it.

42
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,240
So I'm going to Precentor of course is going to do it.

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,840
I'm going to pause and be right back.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,340
Maybe it's going to be done let's give it a minute.

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,010
OK.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,430
Everything was installed.

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,020
So now I have surge in my computer so I can use the search command.

48
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,380
First I'm going to clear.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,440
So now how to upload it.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,670
Really simple.

51
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,720
We'd say search just like this.

52
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:08,660
We said mine is P and we are using minus P because I want to put inside of search I when to upload a

53
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,670
very specific directory which is the build directory to build we have right here.

54
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,060
If I remove the P and I press Enter it's going to try to upload the whole directory all the contents

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,300
inside the venue directory and we don't want that.

56
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,310
We just want to upload to build.

57
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,940
So by doing mynahs P I can specify which directory I want to upload.

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,870
In our case it's going to be built.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,600
So I'm going to say minus the build going to press center and it's going to do something in the background

60
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,410
and you're going to get something like this.

61
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,190
Now I'm getting the e-mail and the token because I'm already registered.

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,060
I've pushed a few projects into search in the past so it's already my computer.

63
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,490
If it's your first time it's going to ask you for your e-mail.

64
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,960
And you know to add a passport and after that it's going to give you some information how many files.

65
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,790
No the main buy in the first time because it is going to give you kind of a dummy domain and right here

66
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,810
you're going to get this square this you know this rectangle and it looks like frozen but it's not it's

67
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,600
a waiting for you to press enter.

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,650
So I'm going to press enter is going to do something is going to start uploading.

69
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,770
It's going to take seconds.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,280
And that is it.

71
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,990
So after it's done it's been a success project.

72
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,300
It's published and running at and this domain.

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,340
So if I copied the domain and I go right here and paste it there you go.

74
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,530
We get our re-act app of course we didn't modify this and we get everything else so everything works

75
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,960
very very good.

76
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:46,800
You know it's really really really simple to use this is kind of my favorite for chest front and applications.

77
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,700
And of course you can do a lot more.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,440
You can add a custom domain Maybe your client has already owns a domain so you can of course add that

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,460
domain and you have kind of a free service.

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Of course we're not a lot of features.

81
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,710
And of course if you pay $3000 a month which is not a lot you get all of the other you know the more

82
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,750
professional features.

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,920
So again everything is on help.

84
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,280
All the topics you will need to find you know adding a 4 or 4 or maybe testing or whatever you have

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,860
it right here.

86
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,750
So it's very very cool.

87
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,830
And that is it.

88
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,200
So remember to go to get help you have the project inside get have you can get the link.

89
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,510
So now we're going to move forward to the next project and it's not going to be this easy.

90
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,610
This is really easy for us.

91
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,370
It took us a few hours maybe two or three hours really really simple but of course this is kind of a

92
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,430
warm up project we're going to do.

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,310
The first one.

94
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,670
The next one we will be doing with indication we will using Abebe we will be using a little bit more

95
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,100
complex animations.

96
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,600
And of course a lot more.

97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,110
So let's go to the next one.

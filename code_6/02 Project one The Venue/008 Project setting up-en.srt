1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,320
OK so let's start with the first project.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,780
So the first project is going to be called the venue.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,530
We've already seen this on the previews of the preview project.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,210
So it's going to be called the venue.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,380
I've opened the virus code and navigated to that directory called the venue.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,090
You can call this whatever you want.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,270
Doesn't really matter.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,570
And then in the batch and the command or if you're in Windows.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,750
Same thing command you can navigate to the same directory.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,060
So the first thing we need to do to start.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,710
It's to create a re-act application right here to bring a template.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,250
So I'm going to be using the see if you didn't solve ACL I just go back a couple of question a couple

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,200
sections and you can find the instructions in how to install the globally.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,640
So we're going to start with create then react and then app.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,010
And since I'm already inside the directory I want are going to do a blank space and a dot and it will

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,660
install everything inside of this directory.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,920
Maybe if you're in a different directory and you want to create a directory and store everything inside

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,070
you will call it or maybe the venue or you know my app or something like that and it will create a directory

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,290
for you and install everything inside.

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,320
So since I'm already inside the directory the venue I'm going to put into place just dot.

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,450
Bryce Precentor and this is of course it's going to take a couple minutes maybe a few seconds and when

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,340
it's done I'll be right back.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,370
OK so everything was installed for me.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,980
Maybe if you're using NPM you're going to get NPM start instead of yorn.

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
I'm using yarned and it's computer Yorn it's kind of a something like NPM.

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,980
They are pretty much the same thing.

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,540
I like to use yarn and NPM comes with a note.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,030
So if you wouldn't Yorn you will need to go and install yarn in your computer.

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,790
If you don't want to there is no no me.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,680
The only thing you need to know is that instead of using yarn you need to use and PM ride and I will

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
tell you when we need to use it.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,070
OK don't worry.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,110
So first I'm going to check if everything was installed successfully.

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,940
So I'm going to do and Yorn start in your case.

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,060
NPM start.

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm going to press enter and this will begin with the development server of this project.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,090
It's going to take a second a few seconds.

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:22,670
OK so after everything you know after this you to get a window just like this with localhost 3000.

39
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,560
So if you're getting this means that everything is OK.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,370
So for now I'm just going to leave it here and I'm going to go back to the terminal and kill the terminal

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,600
kill the command to clear.

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,680
And now would we need to do we need to install all the dependencies we need to use in our project.

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,850
So if you remember in the previous section I gave you a text with an ad and a bunch of commands and

44
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,740
same thing for NPM install.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,300
So I'm going to use I can copy the Yorn one because I'm using yarn.

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,720
If you're using NPM copy the NPM one I'm going to paste it right here.

47
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:02,270
So we will be using materail UI for to create some things than re-act reveal re-act scroll and re-act

48
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,690
slick.

49
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,450
So these are these are third party libraries.

50
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,940
We're going to be using the word whenever we read your section where we use re-act reveal.

51
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,610
I will show you the get have page and everything else.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,760
So for now just going to press enter.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,350
And this is going to take a minute.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,060
We'll be right back.

55
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,970
Whenever this is done OK so everything was installed.

56
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,010
And before we start coding like it tool before if there is something we are not going to do is to see

57
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,820
assess.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,190
And of course we are responsive.

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,090
Right.

60
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,920
So attached to the section on the resources I've added a directory called you know resources you need

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,660
to download that sip and incipit inside of the source begin to drop a resources folder right here.

62
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,790
Going to do that right now.

63
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,720
OK so I've added this directory is going to be called resources.

64
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,680
Again you can call this whatever you want but later of course remember you changed the name right here.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,580
So on this directory you have the images and some icons maybe the sliders.

66
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,160
The images were going to be using on the slider with this woman.

67
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,790
And then of course you get the styles that CSSA.

68
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,090
And this is the all the styles of the web page is not a long web page.

69
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,940
So again we are not going to do styles right here.

70
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,110
We're going to focus everything in that javascript section of the of the project.

71
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,910
So OK.

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,490
So remember to put it inside of the source.

73
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,000
OK.

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:36,130
So to begin first I'm going to go to the app that is going to leave that one I'm going to go to APS-C

75
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,570
assess I'm going to delete this one.

76
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,510
We are not really going to use it are going to go to the app tests.

77
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,490
Not going to use it.

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,040
So delete this.

79
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,940
Then we have an index CSSA.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,580
I'm going to delete this as well.

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,430
What else.

82
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,490
We have the index Dangi as I'm going to leave that one and then logo SPG goodbye logo as Weegee and

83
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,350
then register service worker.

84
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,450
Delete it.

85
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,630
All right so we get we only get the index.

86
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,490
And the app digests.

87
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,990
So on the index dodgiest I'm going to delete this lines because we didn't have those files anymore.

88
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,480
And we're going to get an error.

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,920
So I'm going to delete everything and just leave this this and then of course I'm going to go to Abdin

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:21,880
Jesus I'm going to delete the import for the logo and the APS-C SS and then the return just leave one

91
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,190
day of saying I don't know.

92
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,230
Hello.

93
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,180
All right so now I'm going to go right here and do your start.

94
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,790
We're going to begin with our development server.

95
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,780
Get going to take a second

96
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,130
look at we get hello.

97
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,280
So that is OK.

98
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,560
So we're going to go to the next section if we're going to start building the website.

99
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,660
We're going to build.

100
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,170
We're going to start with the hetter.

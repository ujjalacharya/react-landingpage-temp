1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,110
All right so now we can read the location and the footer and there are going to be real simple so it's

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,510
going to take it's going to take a couple minutes.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,290
So I'm going to go to Google Maps and you know a chosen Magnolia Dallas downtown whatever just to get

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,520
the address of.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,300
Go to Google Maps and get get one link.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,510
Going to use it in a minute.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,180
But first we need to create a component right here.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,540
So I'm going to go to a new folder and I'm going to call this one location.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,140
And inside of location index that day is that yes.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,540
All right we go.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,470
OK.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,390
So again this one is just going to show a map.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:45,550
So there's no need to create a class based component so react stalest component and the name its location.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,480
Now with the wrapper for this one special class.

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,180
So location and then underscore robber Breguet again.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,680
The only thing we need right here is just indifferent.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,480
So I'm going to go and click and share I'm sorry.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,460
Mine has since Panish can change this.

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,230
So I'm going to copy the HVM L and let me open it again.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,370
Because it was NOT GIVE ME SOMETIMES up the the Google Maps fails.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,920
So once I go let me get the address again.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,190
Can I click on this.

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,480
The Dallas aquarium because I should be getting this.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,260
You know that after PV I should be getting this.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,440
I was not getting it.

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:31,150
So I got a copy and I'm going to pay the I-frame right here and make it a little bit nicer after you

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,980
know all the settings.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,780
Sorry for this.

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,090
So we have the long string.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,420
Well when we do it like this why not.

31
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,680
Then at the bottom like this almost done

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,320
and there we go.

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,850
So there's nothing else right.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,780
So OK so we have an I-frame we have the actual link with the word and the word I want to change it to

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,610
100 percent.

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,600
Then the height is going to be 500 pixels around and then three more there is going to be zero.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,390
And if you run just like this re-act is going to give you an error message that frame border should

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,280
be frame border.

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,570
Remember that this is not an actual It's not an actual I-frame.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,500
This is J.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,100
It's just some code which actually which is GSX and it's going to be translated to HVM else so we need

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,270
to use their tax.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,110
Now style I don't need style go back goodbye and allow Fultz full screen.

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,810
It's the same idea allow capital F and then S and that is that.

45
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,210
Then we have the location here at bottom this tack.

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:53,010
So I'm going to go and create a div with a class name of location tag right and on the bottom just Dave

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,010
and then location.

48
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,050
Me write it correctly location.

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,970
OK so now of course we need to include this components.

50
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,360
And one thing before we move forward.

51
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,400
If you run the application and go to go to the console you're going to get an error message from the

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,050
buttons.

53
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,560
It's because of a mistake and I know I should be use soon using small.

54
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,160
And that's it.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,260
Sorry for that.

56
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:21,940
OK.

57
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,030
Let's include the location right here on the top.

58
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,110
So import location.

59
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,830
When they make it ride location from.

60
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:44,520
And you know same thing from components that for Slash components for Slash prizing sorry location location

61
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,800
where you get it.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,410
OK.

63
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,090
So now let's include this after prising location.

64
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,910
And we should be good.

65
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,730
So we are done with this.

66
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,380
So now the next thing is going to be the footer and we are this one is going to be real simple.

67
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,030
And then the next section we're going to create this remember that whenever we click in this we need

68
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,100
to do a scroll and we will use a third party library for this.

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,360
Our on our project the one we are doing right now this one of course does not work.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,900
So let's do the footer.

71
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,500
OK so I'm going to go right here.

72
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,650
And if you remember we have a or fritter component.

73
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,760
So the only thing I need to do is just create a new file with the name footer.

74
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,620
Yes.

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,450
So inside footer we need to create a stateless component.

76
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,610
There's no need to create a class based so re-act stateless component and of course it calls footer.

77
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:50,390
Now inside of the footer are going to change this four footer and the class name it's a b c k.

78
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,150
Red instead of black.

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
Well this one is just red.

80
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:03,530
Now if you notice on the original one whenever we go to the footer reloaded again we get to feeling

81
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,080
that effect from re-act reveal.

82
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:17,740
So I'm going to do import then Faid opening close reac reveal for Slash and then fade up fate.

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,970
There you go.

84
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,110
OK.

85
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,310
So forget the From.

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,260
OK.

87
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,380
So now I'm going to bring Faid just like here and I'm going to do.

88
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm going to select going to put a delay of hundred.

89
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,750
At this point of this you know should be easy for you with this a few times already.

90
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,000
So 500 dead inside of here.

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,240
We have the name of the place.

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,390
So I'm going to say dev with a class name of.

93
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,550
And again we are using that word font which is fonde righteous.

94
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,490
I have it right here let me copy and paste it and then footer.

95
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:02,320
Then Logo and then venue and right here says the venue.

96
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,100
OK so the next thing is going to be the copyright.

97
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,070
I know this is boring but this is something actually we we need we always need to do.

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,360
If you ask me what is the deal part of a web page or an app.

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,440
I hate creating it it's the footer.

100
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,600
I just hate the footer.

101
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,410
I don't know why I just hate them so I don't know electrum.

102
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,210
Maybe not electrum the venue or something like that the venue to 18.

103
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,700
All rights reserved.

104
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:43,620
I hate them because most of the times the client will always ask absurd things sweet things on footer.

105
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,230
I don't know.

106
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,620
It's just the way it is.

107
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:55,720
So I'm going to save it and I'm going to go to app and in poor footer from that for Slash and we we

108
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,800
are almost done and we're going to go to the next one.

109
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,710
The next project and the next one is going to be really really fun.

110
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,820
So footer for her.

111
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,490
All right.

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
So let's go to our project and if we go the bottom up we are not getting it.

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,790
Maybe I didn't say something footer from of course for her.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,020
That was a problem.

115
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,790
Cannot solve for footer.

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,960
So again I made a mistake components and it's inside header footer and then fruiterer.

117
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,870
That's my mistake.

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,210
OK.

119
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,760
So if I go down we get the footer.

120
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,170
OK.

121
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,580
So we are pretty much done.

122
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,980
Let's go to the next section and do the scroll to that.

123
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,200
That's interesting.

124
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,810
So let's go to the next one and do this.

1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,630
Write so now we'll be we will add the button right here so we can cook it and whenever we click it we

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,360
will create a side drawer.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,750
So first is the button.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,110
OK.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,110
So going to go back to our project and if you remember right here we've imported a menu icon and I made

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,560
a mistake.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,110
This one it's not from core is from icons.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,810
It's kind of a different dependency.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,900
If we go to you know the package to Jason we have material you like core and then icons so it's a different

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,540
library.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,200
OK.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,300
So sort of for that are going to go at the bottom and first we need to bring that Bunim now to use buttons

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,070
inside the toolbar and actually inside the module.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,030
We need to use the Eye button.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,220
So we're going to open and say icon button.

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,670
OK.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,210
And remember we are importing Eichenbaum button right here at the top.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,890
So now from within I can button we can put an icon and in this case I'm using a Nikon from you know

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,840
material.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,710
And you can use whatever you want.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,740
It doesn't really matter.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,810
Right here we can see the icons can have a black eye we've going to change that.

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,100
And again if you put your own your own icon is going to work as well.

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,580
But you know this one comes already ready to go.

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,280
OK.

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,150
So the I can button needs some configurations so I'm going to do Area Leavell area labeled just like

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,730
this.

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,750
And this one is going to be a menu.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,850
The color.

30
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,670
And you know the color we will inherit because the color by default it's white.

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,420
So we can get it in a white collar and of course if we cook it nothing happens.

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,480
So in real life what it needs to happen is that whenever we click it we open the side door.

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:52,480
We didn't have a side drawer but are going to add and click event listener opening close.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,440
And in this one whenever we click it we will write a function.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,220
In this case I'm just going to say conc lock open.

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,580
All right.

37
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,330
So let's see if this works.

38
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,420
So inspect and I'm going to go to console.

39
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,920
I'm going to cook it and we get open or whenever I typed it open.

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,540
OK.

41
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,980
You know you're going to get it.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,880
Let's get.

43
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,660
OK so now what we need to do is we need to add a side door just like this.

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,990
So let's do it right now.

45
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,260
All right so let's add this side door first let's go to the documentation.

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,170
So if you go to drawers right here you're going to get.

47
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,680
Of course all the documentation all the this is actually the demo section so you can open it left or

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,810
you can open right.

49
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,440
You can open.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,680
Actually you can open tops of this is really really cool.

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,370
So we can use the open write option.

52
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,500
Now if I show the resource right here of course we need to import drawer and you know set some state

53
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,320
and everything you know like that we go to the door option.

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,680
So which each drawer you can set an encore which is going to be where you're going to open it from the

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,550
left or the right.

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,880
And in this case we're going to be passing an open state.

57
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,740
So whenever the page loads if this is the state top it's actually true.

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:18,080
This you know this value it's true the page will load with the side door open so we can meet to mind

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,620
that.

60
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,560
And then we have a third prop which is going to be the on close whenever we want to close it.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,650
We need to trigger a function to close it so we can change the state of this state that top in this

62
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,510
case.

63
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:31,990
That's fine.

64
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,590
Don't worry.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,070
We're going to do it right now.

66
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,820
So I'm going to go back to our project and I'm going to host the side door on a different file so I'm

67
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:48,470
going to create a new file and this one is going to be called side and then drawer that jacks so the

68
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,850
side door is going to be just a stateless function.

69
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:59,300
So I'm going to use the the in red react state those components going to press center and it will create

70
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,700
a side door for me.

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,880
So I'm in a mistake made changed I always make this mistake.

72
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:11,450
I don't know why something you know so side drawer with a capital S and then side door with a capital

73
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,350
S..

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,140
So this side drawer will be receiving some props which are all the configurations we need to use you

75
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,700
know the ancor maybe or maybe the open this top and everything else.

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,570
In this case we're going to be passing the open and the close props.

77
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,150
All right.

78
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,780
So first we need to import the drawer from the top so I have it right here.

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,890
So we have it right here drawer.

80
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,090
So I'm going to copy this one and paste it right here at the top import drawer from multi-role you I

81
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,750
court's always the same thing.

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,270
And then drawer them are going to be using list and then list item.

83
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,810
I have the list right here so I'm a little bit lazy so i going to copy and paste it's import list from

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,080
then material the core and then just list and we're going to be using one more thing I'm going to import

85
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,000
right here.

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,810
It's called a list item.

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,310
We're going to talk about this in a couple minutes.

88
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,350
So again is from matyr you ice core and then you know same name list item.

89
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,560
Right.

90
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,480
So we have there's three things we can be using.

91
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,220
Now this component will just return the drawer.

92
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,990
So I'm going to delete this step to open and close tag and say door open and close and inside of here

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,880
we will get you know our door.

94
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,910
So we're right now I'm going into say door.

95
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,290
That's good.

96
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,250
So the door just like we spoke briefly.

97
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,970
It receives a Natcore which is going to be where are we going to be opening it in the right or the left.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,050
In this case is going to be that right now we have an open prop which is required.

99
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,860
We need to pass it and then we have a nun close which is what's going to happen whenever the we want

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,980
to close this.

101
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,870
And this one it's a function in this case.

102
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,100
So we didn't have that function right now.

103
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,440
So we're going to be passing it from the parents which is Hetter now from within.

104
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,810
Within Hetter we need to include the side door so I'm going to import.

105
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,250
Right.

106
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,650
OK I'm going to go at the bottom import then side door.

107
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,900
Just like this drawer from.

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,820
And then that for Slash and then side door.

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,330
So I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go at the bottom and include the side door on the on the

110
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,140
actual header.

111
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,760
So right that's the only thing we need to do right now.

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,840
Let me make it at self-closing tack.

113
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,720
So if you remember we need to be passing from parents to child.

114
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,260
The Open and the unclose property.

115
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,460
So right here we will get an open equals to you know something we're going to be adding right now and

116
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,260
then and close.

117
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,050
All right.

118
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:57,540
Open and close the open is going to be true or false if we want the door open whenever the app starts

119
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:05,470
it's going to be true or false so I'm going to store this inside this state and then door and that open.

120
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,730
We don't have the state going to create right now.

121
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:15,390
So we're going to go right here at the top and again going to say state open and close and we will be

122
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,310
adding the of course the state.

123
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,980
So in this case is door open.

124
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,470
And whenever the application starts I want it closed.

125
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
So it's going to be false.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,570
All right so now we are we are passing this that state jor.

127
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,810
So the this when will we be receiving a prop called Open.

128
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:42,150
So we need to pass probes and then oh sorry props that open.

129
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,850
All right.

130
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,750
And remember this is a stateless component.

131
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,620
We don't need to use this that props.

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,740
It's not a class.

133
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,500
All right.

134
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,940
So now we need to create a function that it will tackling that this state door open whenever we want

135
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,130
to close it.

136
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,630
Now we didn't have this function or could it create right now it's real simple.

137
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,940
So I can run a function.

138
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,280
And whenever we run this function we're going to be passing a value in this case.

139
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:16,820
And then this is going to be does that toggle and then door open and close and then value.

140
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:23,700
Now maybe there is no need to pass a value we can just you know use a turnaround but the time for now

141
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,980
is just going to be passing the value.

142
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,820
I want to show you something else.

143
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:34,180
So inside side drawer whenever we click whenever the drawer wants to close we will fire this around.

144
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,680
OK.

145
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,930
So inside side drawer are going to be making a reference to the props we are passing which is probs

146
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,650
on close and then false.

147
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,210
So and this is why I want to show you because maybe you didn't know it.

148
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,310
Right here we are passing a prop called on close.

149
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,700
Right.

150
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,290
OK.

151
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,310
So this one is just a function.

152
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,530
We don't have this function.

153
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,080
You're going to create it right now.

154
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,660
So this function is going to be running this with the with an argument which in this case is going to

155
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,280
be false.

156
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:11,200
So from within here will trigger the this function called unclose on close makes a reference to this

157
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,520
the Tuggle and this unclose we see if that falls.

158
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,990
So grab false run this function and it's kind of a passing this to this.

159
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,090
So this pretty much are the same thing.

160
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,430
If I don't do this this value this double door will never receive that false.

161
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,010
I need to pass it from no child to parent.

162
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,080
That's why I want to show you this.

163
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:42,060
So we don't have this function is a really dumb function going to go with the top and say Tuggle dollar

164
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,020
equals you know just a function opening close and this will we will be setting the.

165
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:56,280
This nut said state opening close and it's going to be door open and then banlieue.

166
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,400
All right.

167
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,320
So we are receiving a value which is the actual prop which is just false.

168
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,160
We could just say you know false or something like that.

169
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,670
But in this case I wanted to show you this OK.

170
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,930
Right so let's try to open the talk of the sidebar so I'm going to refresh the web page.

171
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm going to open and nothing happens because when I click it we are getting this Cancellara.

172
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,270
So whenever we are clicking it we are not really opening anything because the unclick it's just cancel

173
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,960
luck.

174
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,330
So we need to change it of course.

175
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,950
And we're going to be using the toggle drawer as why we are doing this like this.

176
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,300
So whenever we click the disk that toggle the drawer the value it's going to be true.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,780
Right because we want that to change the state of the drawer open to true.

178
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,430
All right.

179
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,030
Right now it's false.

180
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,610
So if I reload the application I click it and we get the jar or I can remember if you change the default

181
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:57,480
defaults to true and you reload the application is going to you know start as open but we don't want

182
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:57,840
that.

183
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,390
In this case.

184
00:10:59,390 --> 00:10:59,730
All right.

185
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,470
So everything works fine right now.

186
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,550
So of course in real life we're going to get something like this.

187
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,170
So notice when I hoover it can it get kind of this but in effect.

188
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,860
And if I click it we will of course go to a different section on the page.

189
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,660
But you're not going to do that right now.

190
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,020
So on the side door we need to add something called List and list items to show you right here.

191
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:32,190
So material you go to lists at the bottom you can get something like this nested list so you can get

192
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,110
this effect with lists.

193
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,040
And of course you can nest lists and everything else.

194
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,670
So we will be using this inside of that now.

195
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,550
All right.

196
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,880
So on the side drawer are going to go and create a list just like this year.

197
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:53,340
Remember we are importing this at the top so this list meets what kind of component we're going to be

198
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,880
using.

199
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,190
And in this case it's going to be a nav because we're using it inside of a navigation.

200
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,560
So inside of here we need to add each button.

201
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,610
We're going to be using right here and for this one we use the list item.

202
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:17,630
So I'm going to open and close that and this list item needs some configuration.

203
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,280
And in this case what is this list item is going to be.

204
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,330
And in this case I'm going to say button and all this is on the documentation.

205
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,870
So whenever we use button it will do that.

206
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,120
You know how we're in fact and everything else.

207
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,610
If you don't use it it's going to do something else.

208
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,780
So whenever we we click this button we need to do something.

209
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:45,170
So I will attach an on click with a function and for now we are just going to do console log.

210
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,070
And in this case the first button is going to be featured it's just going to say featured.

211
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,940
All right.

212
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,080
So this one will be the option.

213
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:03,350
Event Starts in which Actually it's you know when the event starts the main section of our Web page.

214
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,010
OK.

215
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,780
So.

216
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,230
Right.

217
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,910
Are going to write it.

218
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:16,070
Event starts and if I reload the application Mikko's that's going to open and we get you know that same

219
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,930
effect event starts in.

220
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,380
And if I click it and go to inspect we get the console feature.

221
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,970
All right.

222
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,830
So now pretty much we need to do the same thing for all the other options when you impose highlights

223
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:35,100
pricing and location and later we going to be creating a different function so we can scroll to a section

224
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,070
but it's a little bit more complicated than it is than it sounds.

225
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,180
So a list item.

226
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,250
The second one is going to be Benue info.

227
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,530
I mean do with capital and f o going to copy paste.

228
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,540
Sorry for that.

229
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,740
The mike is maybe too close.

230
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,780
So list item.

231
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,910
The next one is going to be highlights.

232
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,380
So he's going to write highlights.

233
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,490
There you go.

234
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,580
Sorry high lights.

235
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,050
There we go.

236
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,460
Copy paste.

237
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,660
Then we have the prising.

238
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,250
So let me remove this prising now we're almost done.

239
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,330
I'm going to copy one more and this one is going to be location location.

240
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,360
So I'm going to reload it.

241
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,210
And if we open we get all the options.

242
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:40,310
Now there's one more thing I want to do before we finish with the header and everything else.

243
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:47,910
So right now on the final one if I scroll to the top we get kind of a you know transparent effect.

244
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,840
And if you scroll down you know it shows with the background color.

245
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,980
So first to do this and to to check if everything is working with a fixed position.

246
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,400
I need to add more height to the you know to our application.

247
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,760
So I'm going to go to the app then yes.

248
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,940
And I'm just going to hard code some styling so we can you know simulate that we have actual real content

249
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,590
in our web page.

250
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,450
So I'm going to add height.

251
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,450
There we go a height of I don't know something big 100.

252
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,260
Yeah that's good pixels.

253
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,040
Very good.

254
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,180
And I'm going to change the background because I want to see that you know transparency.

255
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,860
So I'm going to ride corn flower blue.

256
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,210
You can put red or whatever doesn't matter.

257
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,200
So OK so we get this.

258
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,930
And if I scroll down the header it's in a position fixed.

259
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,010
So this this proposition fixed works.

260
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:55,990
Now when I when I am at the top of the screen when I want to do I want to give Does this transparency.

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,440
Right.

262
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,050
And when I scroll I went to show the color so we can do that.

263
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,690
And the next action.

264
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,990
Let's go to the next one.

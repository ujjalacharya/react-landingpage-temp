1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,020
OK so now we're going to be creating this module this component the venue info and then highlights are

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:12,200
going to be real simple which is do transitions and animations with the same re.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,630
Right here same Briac reveal we've been using that really hard to use.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,400
So like I told before this the first project it's really simple is just to warm up the next one next

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,880
once you know the second and the third are not going to be that simple.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,460
They're going to be very long and we're going to do a lot of things.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,040
All right.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,500
So let's start with this one.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,670
This one this component.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,570
I'm going to call it the venue info.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,680
So I'm going to go to component's create a new folder called Benue info.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:50,880
Now inside of your index dodginess and instead of index dodgiest this info is going to be a re-act stimulus

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,020
component so reactive stateless components and again to change name to venue info or something like

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,440
that.

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,430
All right.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,370
If you notice on the original on the final one you have a calendar icon and a location icon and they

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,050
are inside the resources icons you have location and Kandar.

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,560
OK.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,750
So we need to kind of bring it.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,610
So import let me do it right.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:24,160
Import and I'm going to call it icon and then calendars like that from opening close that that for Slashdot

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,760
that for Slash resources we have it inside images.

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,260
We have it inside icons and then forward slash.

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,880
And I believe it's a calendar.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,700
There we go.

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,600
All right.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,920
So then we do the same thing.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,560
But the other one instead of Candar is going to be location.

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,350
So can location.

30
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,330
And of course same thing here.

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,860
Can I delete it for Slash and location P and G.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,670
Right.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,490
OK.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,700
So first we need to create this wrapper.

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,310
So it's going to be this step.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,360
So class name opening close and I added a class called back black because the bad container for this

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,690
one is kind of black.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,370
So whenever we add something right here I don't know whatever.

39
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,080
And we can put in LOTES.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,010
We should because something of course we need to include this inside the V right here.

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,610
The actual page.

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,100
So let me go there.

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,240
One second me component's index app.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,930
Yeah.

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:38,420
So import import Benue info from that for Slash components and then venue info.

46
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,660
Right.

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,910
So I'm going to make a reference to Benue info.

48
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,850
Open and close self-closing stack.

49
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,310
And if the compound reloads we get back with you.

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,050
Hahaha.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,770
All right.

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,160
So I going to go back to Benue info now.

53
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,300
We need to we have kind of a centered container right here.

54
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:07,610
So again we're going to create a div inside a div a class name of center center and then wrap her right

55
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,980
now inside of the center wrapper.

56
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,220
I created a different wrapper.

57
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,760
This is something you know I would like to do sometimes depending on what I'm going to doing or going

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,220
to do.

59
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,600
So I'm going to just wrap everything inside of a new wrapper.

60
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,040
That's OK.

61
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,790
So we have three different properties now.

62
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:30,950
Then inside of this A B and rubber We have two different parts we have the last left box in the right

63
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,840
box.

64
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,280
And since this one uses flex we just can make a reference to a div and this one go to the left and the

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,810
other one goes to the right.

66
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,710
Just like this.

67
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,830
Find out which is going to create the first one.

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,170
So the first one has a class name of V and and then item.

69
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:56,630
All right then the end item has a div and I'm going the the inside of the B B and item.

70
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,770
I am going to get a class name of B and outer you know see why in a minute.

71
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,280
And inside a different wrapper with dvn.

72
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,880
And in this in this case is going to be inner.

73
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,400
OK.

74
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:19,120
So class name be an inner or so outer and inner.

75
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,920
Now of course this square is kind of an in a position absolute.

76
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,280
So it's kind of floating.

77
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,850
So this is where the where this icon is going to go on at a different place of course.

78
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,970
So the time doesn't matter.

79
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:38,990
So inside of that we an inner eye are going to say div and I'm going to add a class name off and it's

80
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,930
going to be an icon.

81
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,080
So this is actually the I can be a guinea Using going to use right here and the icon.

82
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:53,690
I give it a name of a square now b c k Red is going to be for the background red and then the other

83
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,530
one for the background of yellow.

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
But the first one is red.

85
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,080
So we're going to make just a reference to the first one.

86
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,420
Now if I go back.

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:00,760
OK.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,350
We have the box and we have the actual you know box right here.

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:14,780
Now instead of here I'm going to say Dave I'm going to create a class name of B an icon and inside of

90
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,930
the ME AN ICON are going to be adding more classes.

91
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,470
And what I'm going to be wanting.

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,480
It's the icon.

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,410
So it's a div with a red square and on top floating on top of the main container we have the actual

94
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,140
icon.

95
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,800
So what I'm doing here is just adding the icon directly from the component and not through CSSA.

96
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,280
So background open and close.

97
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,280
We use templates strings you are l and we make a reference to the calendar icon.

98
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,660
We've imported the top right.

99
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,620
OK.

100
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,680
So OK.

101
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,350
So this is it if I reload it we get you know the Red Square and the calendar icon.

102
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,220
Then of course if you go to the final we have a date and we have a time.

103
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,880
OK.

104
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:05,990
So after the see and icon are going to go and create a new div called div and actually adding a class

105
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:15,700
name of B and title and this one will be the title which is event date and time sign and copy paste

106
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,040
it and then have the description.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:27,860
So I'm going to create a div with a class name of B an desk of description and begin to copy this which

108
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,620
is $7.

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,160
You can you can put whatever you want right here.

110
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,320
Doesn't really matter.

111
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,330
So the application.

112
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,770
That's it.

113
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,870
We get it.

114
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,510
So I'm going to copy to be an item going to put it right here at the bottom and it just duplicate the

115
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,530
contents.

116
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,710
So since we are we are using on the container opposition flexed.

117
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,770
It's going to put it on the correct position.

118
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,800
But the changes and the color of this and the text of course changes as well.

119
00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:00,470
So on the second one instead of B C K red it's going to be b c k yellow and the icon is going to be

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,620
location and the data inside is going to change.

121
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,090
So the title is going to be event location.

122
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,620
You can put again whatever you want.

123
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,150
And on the address you can put whatever you want and it's up to you.

124
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,710
Then again this is just for practice.

125
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,300
So if you're below the application we get it and then your review is simple to do.

126
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,650
I'm not teaching you anything new right here.

127
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,290
But the only thing is that the difference is that what whenever the application loads and we load the

128
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,550
component you're going to do that same transition.

129
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,260
And this comes from re-act reveal so at the top we don't have it.

130
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,150
So we need to import it.

131
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,390
And what we can to be using is the soome option inside re-act reveal.

132
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,090
So I'm going to copy this from here and paste it right here at the top.

133
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,250
So we are importing soome from re-act reveal for Slash suit.

134
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,650
So how to use it.

135
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,170
OK.

136
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,760
So first I'm going to go right here on the to the first item and I'm going to say soome Oh sorry soome.

137
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,030
Open and Close.

138
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,780
Now organic.

139
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,600
Copy this.

140
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,370
Just chop it and put it right here OK so soon.

141
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,050
If you remember any of the all this this options inside react we'll.

142
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,800
We have some configuration we can use.

143
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:30,540
So in this case I want to set a duration so I'm going to say duration and this is how long the animation

144
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,990
is going to last.

145
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,270
So whenever we load the component we should be getting the duration.

146
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,110
So let me save it and go again.

147
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,000
So we go.

148
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,700
We have that soome and it last 500 milliseconds.

149
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,460
Now I want to do I want to do the same thing with the other one but I want to you know DeLay give you

150
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,990
a kind of delay.

151
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,980
I want to load this one first sumed this one first and then this one after this one it's done.

152
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,840
So I will do pretty much the same thing.

153
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,120
I will wrap everything.

154
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,510
I mean the second item inside of assume opening close.

155
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:14,320
And then I can copy the contents put it inside of the second soome And in this case we will give a do

156
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,680
ration again of 500.

157
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:27,040
Of course five hundred and decide just like with it before just going to do a delay delay of five hundred.

158
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,670
So when the application reloads

159
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,900
the application reloads first the first we have left and then we have the second one and that isn't

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,210
good.

161
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,560
We have the second component totally was it going to be really simple.

162
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,940
So the next one is going to be the highlights.

163
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,130
And we do pretty much the same thing but we do three different.

164
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,850
We have three different components.

165
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,540
The top the left the ride.

166
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,830
And we have different transitions on this ones.

167
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,560
So let's go to the next section and do the highlights.

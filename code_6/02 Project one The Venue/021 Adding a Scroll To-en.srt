1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,440
All right so now we're going to do the scroll thing.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,230
So what do we need to do.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:13,390
In theory is just open the side door and click on a section and the page will scroll to that section.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,630
So what do we need to do pretty much is to connect this side door right here.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,800
Remember we have a list item where we can click on a console log we click on the link for example venue

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:32,570
info and then here we can a can it trigger function or tell the application to scroll to you know a

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,880
different component.

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,280
So we can a need to to bind to connect this unclick with one of the sections.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,720
This is what we need to do.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,860
So I'm going to be using a third party library calls re-act scrawl the documentation and this one it's

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,950
not really great but it works very very good.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
So right here you get all the documentation for this.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,890
Now you have all of this options.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,470
This is the kind of the usage or the demo.

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,130
And in real life if you're you don't need all this they just put everything right here.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,720
You know it's not a very clear demonstration right here you have all the prompts begin to use some of

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,410
them.

18
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,950
So do not read the documentation just yet.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,580
I'm going to show you how to do this and you can see that it's much much simpler than doing all of this.

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,490
OK so I'm going to go to the side drawer and first on the side drawer we need to called in to bring

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,240
this third party library.

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,170
This is the way they tell you to do it now instead of importing all the stars means all we don't need

23
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,910
all we just need one thing and we don't need all of this we just need this crawler property.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,720
So I going to go right here.

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,480
Import opening close and I'm going to say scroller and this is the only thing we need right here.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,880
So from re-act scrawl.

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,010
All right.

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,230
And if you remember of course we already have an install and we just make sure we scroll.

29
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,030
Very good.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
So on the side drawer we have the scroller Burguet.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,380
So now whenever we click on something we want to trigger a function.

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,790
Ok so I'm going to create a function I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to call

33
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,040
it I don't know.

34
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,060
Scroll to element makes sense.

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,650
Scroll to elements something like that.

36
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,000
This Curle 2 element is going to be just a function.

37
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,510
Open and close.

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,770
And this one will be receiving an element.

39
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,470
So this is the argument we're going to be getting.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,350
And the element is where we're going to go.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,720
We're going to go to Benue to highlights prizing or location.

42
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,200
So now to use it first we need to make use of the thing we imported at the top.

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:52,550
So scroller now dot and this is cruller has a method called scroll to.

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,730
Now the scroll to is just a function right.

45
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,070
And this function needs two things needs two properties.

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,580
It needs the elements where are we going to be you know going to which is element and then a callback

47
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,090
function.

48
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,250
I'm sorry then the configuration of this squaller.

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,670
So right here in this is simple it's just the props we have right here at the bottom.

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,240
So we can set the duration.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,650
How much is it going to last this transition.

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,860
So I'm going to add one and a half second delay.

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,650
How much is going to wait before it starts transition.

54
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,880
So the delay is just one hundred.

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:40,880
Now then you have a smooth you know you get that fancy transition which is going to be true and that

56
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,190
is going to show you maybe a couple more but for now this is this is good.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,170
So now whenever we click on one an element for example the highlights we want to go to highlight So

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,040
instead of doing a console log are going to make a reference to scroll to elements.

59
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,670
So I'm going to delete the console log in highlights for example and I'm going to say OK this time I

60
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,490
want to run a function that does scroll to elements and then the name of where we want to go.

61
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,610
In this case I'm going to say high lights something like that.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,260
So now whenever we click this this is going to trigger the function and the scroller the main mistake

63
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,690
right here is scroll to.

64
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,960
This is scroller.

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,210
We'll try to find an element on our project on our No.

66
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,020
Our app calls highlights.

67
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,620
And the thing is we didn't have that.

68
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,450
We just have components.

69
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:40,190
So this scroller gives you a different a different part inside the library where we can wrap a component

70
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,300
with a scroll too with which what does it as a reference to that components that meet let the show you

71
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,120
are going to go for example.

72
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,010
Here we are clicking on highlights.

73
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,460
So we need to go to the highlight component.

74
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,780
Where do we have the highlight component inside up.

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,620
Yes right here right here we have the highlight so you know we need kind of a a way to say OK scroll

76
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,560
to this one which is the name is going to be high light.

77
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,630
So the scroller will know that the name of this one is highlight.

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,460
So to do this we need to bring on elements you know a component from reactive scroll.

79
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,740
So we're going to go right here after the styles maybe and import.

80
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,250
And this one scrolls element.

81
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:37,190
So it's going to be from and then react react scroll.

82
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,610
So now what we do we need to grab this element and drop the highlight just like you're going to say

83
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,790
elements and inside can put highlights.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,930
Let me make this a little bit better.

85
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,930
So now this element needs to know this element.

86
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,330
It's actually from reac scroll so the scroller knows that we have an element but we still need to pass

87
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,320
the name so we add the property name.

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,450
In the case of highlight we said that we want to go to the name of highlights.

89
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,880
So again to say highlights and that is that they're going to reload the application are going to go

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:22,070
are here and if I click on highlights Oh I made a mistake or scroll to element is not a function.

91
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,890
OK.

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,330
Let me just double check.

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,170
I made a mistake on this one.

94
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,850
Now it happens.

95
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,850
Oh I know why.

96
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,800
I know why.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,930
And using I'm not like I'm not in a class and I'm making a reference to this.

98
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,090
So it's not this is just called two elements.

99
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,830
Let's try again.

100
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,390
So highlights and if I do it.

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,930
OK.

102
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:49,770
You know it's kind of like going to highlights the thing is that we have a floating a header a fixed

103
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,800
header so it's going to the right spot but the header.

104
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,560
It's kind of in the way now with a yes called to we can set an offset.

105
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,570
So we're going to say coma and then off and then set and I get to say minus 150 whatever.

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,220
Ok let's try again.

107
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,290
Going to go right here.

108
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,330
The top click it highlights and OK now is good.

109
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,820
But the problem is that the the side drawer it's not closing.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,480
OK.

111
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,490
So what we can do we can enter props if you remember the the the props on close.

112
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,690
We get this function that closes the side drawer.

113
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,010
We have it inside props on close so I can copy this and say OK whenever you go to do whatever it is

114
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:42,900
that you want to do just close the sides or try again to reload it going to go to the top go to highlights

115
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,130
and that is that.

116
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,830
All right.

117
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,390
So now we need to do the same thing with the other ones.

118
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:55,050
So we're going to do pretty much the same thing right here I'm just going to delete this and just delete

119
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,020
the names I'm going to complete this in a second.

120
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,710
So it's called two elements and location and highlights.

121
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,680
Of course it's already done.

122
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,670
So the first one I'm going to call it featured the second one.

123
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:16,430
It's Benue info like that the this one is surprising.

124
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,920
And the last one.

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,620
It's location right location.

126
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:21,780
OK.

127
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,310
And I'm going to I'm going to make this a little bit bigger and I'm going to buy this so I can get you

128
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,210
know the names right here.

129
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,360
So it's feature info highlights and prizing.

130
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,250
So we need to repeat the same steps.

131
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:44,070
So we're going to copy this paste it over here at the bottom and close the elements.

132
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,800
Elements or go there we go.

133
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
We're almost done.

134
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,650
And the name is going to be featured.

135
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,370
We're going to repeat the same the same process with Benue evil.

136
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,470
I'm not going to make it a little bit faster.

137
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,840
Call the venue info remove it replace it and then just replace the name highlights.

138
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,840
It's already done so I'm going to copy this one.

139
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,470
Paste that copy the prizing remove the highlights and just change the name.

140
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,230
And one more to go location.

141
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,670
So copy the location remove prizing and then location.

142
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,090
OK so in theory this should work.

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,900
Let me just close this.

144
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:42,170
OK so let me go back to the Rhine so I get to go to the top so I'm going to start from location to location.

145
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,040
We get it all right if I go to events starts in.

146
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,350
Which is feature all right we get it.

147
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,870
I mean your info then highlights and then prizing.

148
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,690
So OK so everything works correctly and this is the last thing we're going to do for this project right.

149
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,590
Right now it's done so we can see if we can see how to upload how to put it inside of inside of a production

150
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,010

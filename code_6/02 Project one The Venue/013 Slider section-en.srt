1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,910
OK so let's create the slider for this.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,420
So we have three different parts on this slider.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,090
We have you know the actual slider.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,850
We have this text with the name of the singer.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,480
I've never listened to a singer before.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,540
It's not my style.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,450
I just choose someone that maybe you know someone popular.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,210
I don't really like this music but that's OK with you I am much more like a jackass fashion that kind

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,690
of music you know really old.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,660
So this div with the name of the singer is going to be on top of the slider and then on top and have

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,920
this event start.

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,700
And this one it's an obsession absolutely sticked to the bottom of the container.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,060
Look up first before we do anything we need to create a place where we will be hosting the files.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,760
So we're going to create a new folder and I'm going to call the section featured.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,920
Now this feature will will contain an index dodgiest with all the other components.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,370
So the index digests of this one is going to be just that re-act stateless component and are going to

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,350
change the name to featured in something like that.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,910
All right.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,140
Copy and paste.

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,700
Now again the container needs to be positioned relative so we can float this right here the bottom and

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,060
float this in the middle.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,510
So I'm going to change the style.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:27,840
Style equals to open and close position and then relative Vergon first thing.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,280
Right here we're going up with the carousel in a minute.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,940
But first I'm going to put div..

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,270
And then you know I'm going to put the container where we where we put this in the middle of the screen

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:47,910
and the class name for this one is going to be artist and then name and instead of this just a div with

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,000
a class name of wrap her.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,570
Right.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,160
And then of course the name of the artist.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:03,370
I've never listened to this girl before the singer a more kind of a jazz fashion rock kind of guy but

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,070
you know I picked this singer because she's popular and everyone knows her.

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,020
And that's good.

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,910
So now of course if I reload the application nothing happens because we're not including this featured

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,680
component inside of the app.

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,270
All right.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:31,990
So first we need to import so import featured from forward slash components for Slash featured and that

38
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,190
is that because we have an index so there's no need to put index right here.

39
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:43,120
So I'm going to make a reference to a featured opening close and if we reload the application we get

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,520
it.

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,440
Now the problem is that the div that contains this ariana grande and everything else is not big enough

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,600
to put this in the center.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,410
And this is because the device that it's going to be expanding this container is going to be the slider

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,740
and we're going to be using re-act slick.

45
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,730
So let me go to react slick and get to the Get Help page.

46
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,230
So this is one reacts licked react carousel component.

47
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:21,710
So again this is a third party library where we can but we can use to create that kind of slide you

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:29,560
know behavior and right here we need it we can do this or you can add the CD and link in your H Tim

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,720
L which is the slick CSSA and the theme.

50
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,420
And we will meet the CSSA for the sliders.

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,200
So I'm going to copy this.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,470
I'm going to go to I'm going to save this.

53
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm going to go to that e-mail and I'm going to pace the styles because we are going to need it.

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,460
It's not you know it's going to look really really ugly.

55
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:54,820
Now if we go to the example we need to import slider from Riak slick and you know inside of a class

56
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,350
we need to pass the settings to the actual Slider.

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,610
It's a really really simple to use.

58
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,340
Right.

59
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,770
So we don't have a component that hosts this carousel.

60
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,830
So inside of feature I would create a new file called Carrousel.

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,070
Let me make it right.

62
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,800
All right.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,390
Yes.

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,520
Now this one is going to be a classmate component or it could be a stateless component.

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,150
Going to create a stateless component react to stateless component.

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:35,250
So instead of carrousel we need to bring this import slider so we can import the slick slider and instead

67
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,840
of this of course we need to start passing the settings and creating the slider before we do that.

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,200
I going to go to the index and require this image carrousel or this carousel.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,170
So import then carrousel from Carrousel.

70
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,430
There we go.

71
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm going to copy and paste it down here.

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,700
OK.

73
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,720
So of course nothing is going to really happen right now.

74
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,000
So inside of the carousel we need to first do the settings.

75
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,920
If you go to the documentation we need to create a maybe a concert or let where we host the settings

76
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,490
of the actual slider.

77
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,080
So I'm going to do that since we have a stateless component.

78
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,930
I can just create a viral load right here called settings equals to open and close.

79
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,840
So I want to remove the dots and of course for this you can remove it check the documentation on this

80
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,030
so we can remove the dots and the dots are the you know the little dots we get at the bottom of the

81
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,780
slider.

82
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,640
So we can change positions.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,780
I don't really want it got to say infinite just like this and true.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,580
So it's going to start looping in an infinite way.

85
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,280
So then I would play.

86
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,130
So true.

87
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,920
And the speed is going to be 500 of course you can modify this into whenever you want doesn't matter.

88
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,760
Now the carousel are going to put this on on a container right.

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,750
And you can see why in a minute.

90
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:13,930
So this container and I'm going to put this on the bottom we'll have a class name of carousel and then

91
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,510
wrapper.

92
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:22,460
Now if you're wondering why I'm using you know custom CSSA and not using something like bootstrap or

93
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:31,880
something else it's because how boring would be to do call dash em asked 12 call dash em as Tony call

94
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,160
dash M-S And you know that would be really really boring.

95
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,270
So I did my own classes which has all the you know the properties right there.

96
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,790
So this class theme is going to be the actual wrapper.

97
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:51,530
And then I will do something I'm going to add a style I can change some styles and I'm going to add

98
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,720
an overflow.

99
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,030
It's going to be hidden just like this and I'm going to do something else.

100
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,940
Now if you notice whenever the application load this is the final one the height of the slider is the

101
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,940
height of the actual you know actual window.

102
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,240
If I scroll down the next component begins.

103
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,830
So if I make this smaller.

104
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,080
Make it a little bit smaller and reload the application the application.

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,960
Our component is going to calculate the height of the window and make it as big as that.

106
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,110
So scroll down the next component begins.

107
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,680
So we're going to do that.

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,810
Let me go back and if I reload again full with full height.

109
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,630
So how can we do this really simple.

110
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,720
Whenever the application loads or the components you know renders I want to calculate the height of

111
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,440
the screen and I'm going to be using template strings.

112
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,880
And then I can calculate the window.

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,420
And this is vanilla javascript not react windowed.

114
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,260
And I'm going to calculate the inner height and then of course I'm going to be passing pixels.

115
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,010
So whenever the application starts you know the height of the component is the height of the you know

116
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,060
the up the window.

117
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,260
So let me put a background so we can clearly see it.

118
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,990
So it's going to be red.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,700
There we go.

120
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:21,850
So we get to read and if I go down you know that ends let us get let me remove this.

121
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,120
So what else we need to start adding the slider and the slider.

122
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,310
We just need to use the component we've imported the top pass the settings and inside put whatever we

123
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,840
want.

124
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,390
OK.

125
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,550
So right here I'm going to make a reference to this slider.

126
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,600
We are importing the top slider open close.

127
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,130
OK.

128
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,060
So we need to pass the settings so open and close.

129
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,830
Dot dot dot and then settings.

130
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:55,350
So if you are not really sure with your sex whenever we do dot dot dot instead of this we are putting

131
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,080
all the props everything we have inside this object because it is an object inside of the slider and

132
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,470
we pass it as props.

133
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,170
So it's going to be at the end you know be behind scenes.

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,650
It's going to be like dots equal to then infinite a call to something like that.

135
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,110
But you know it's much much much easier to do that than that and then pass the settings.

136
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,250
OK.

137
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,750
So right here we need to start adding the images Songun to say DIVX and image 1 something like that

138
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,410
then Divx image too.

139
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,180
And I believe we have three images for this singer.

140
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,880
So Image three.

141
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,740
OK.

142
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,500
So if I go here right here image one any fight.

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,950
Move it.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,770
Image.

145
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,990
And same thing if I move it emits three.

146
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,540
OK.

147
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:55,500
So now we need to bring the images if we go to resources inside images we have slide one slide three

148
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,240
and slide two.

149
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,830
So we are going to import the images right here at the top so we can use it.

150
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,430
So import that is slide one.

151
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,380
You can call this again whatever you want.

152
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,310
As a matter right now.

153
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:18,630
And it's from that that forward slash that forward slash resources images and then slide one right and

154
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,610
all the other ones are going to be pretty much the same song going to copy paste and change this one

155
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,670
to two.

156
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,750
And this one today.

157
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,190
All right.

158
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:35,750
And the next one image slide three and this one slide three.

159
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,670
All right.

160
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,870
So now inside of this I'm going to delete this one I'm going to say Dave can create a new div with a

161
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:55,240
class name of carrousel image image Breguet and inside of here I will add style let me make it just

162
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,300
like this so you know a little bit nicer.

163
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:06,120
So instead of here you know I'll be adding a style and I'll be passing the background image as a prop.

164
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,480
Right.

165
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,500
So background equals opening close templates strings.

166
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm going to say you are opening close and we need to pass the.

167
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,410
In this case the slide number one.

168
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,780
And then of course the height is going to be the full height of the window just like with it before.

169
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,920
So I'm going to copy from here.

170
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,780
So I'm going to copy paste.

171
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:36,700
So instead of adding the the node can have an EMG with source and passing a div with the background

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,150
so we can use that position cover or position contain.

173
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,310
We can use to make use of that.

174
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,900
Let me go right here now if I copy this one and you can see it right here I'm going to copy that image

175
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,820
number two.

176
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,590
And of course change the name because it's going to be image number two.

177
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,170
We could create a loop and loop it from function.

178
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,410
But this is really easy guys.

179
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,840
There's no way to do this.

180
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,890
We're going to do a lot of a lot of that in the next few projects.

181
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,690
OK.

182
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,640
So I'm going to reload it and we get it.

183
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,720
And if I move it we get the second slide and then we get the third slide and we start again.

184
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,560
If you scroll down everything else it's so good you know thing works really really really simple.

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,520
So the next step will be adding the event starts in.

186
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,680
So let's go to the next section and finish the featured component.

1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,880
OK so now we're going to create this now on the pre's one of the matches we did the at the edit match

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:14,020
because it was a little bit easier you know which is have some texts but if we go to players inside

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,810
players we have the last name the name the number the position and then we have an image and this image

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:26,590
this ID it's referring to whatever we have inside storage we will upload images inside storage.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,910
But this doesn't exist in your storage.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:36,030
I gave you a copy of this database which is a different database different firebase project they have

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,860
my computer where I have all the images inside.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,700
And I cannot just give you the images you know like I meant just to give you a file so you can upload

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,570
images.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,480
So we're going to create the file upload directly and then we will update all the players.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,350
But first to do that we need a way of course to have all this functionality and to add a new player.

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,130
All right.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,500
OK.

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,540
So we're going to do it.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,410
We're going to do it in a kind of a backwards.

16
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,430
First the player and then the add and then the edit player.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:05,930
All right.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,580
So of course we need to do a lot of things right here.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,060
A lot of things are going to be very similar to to EDID edit match pretty much similar.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,440
But of course with some new things.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,900
All right.

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:25,120
So first first thing first of course we need to create an endpoint where we can grab all this code so

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,250
that and then edit just like we did before at edit.

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:37,240
But this one is going to be players and going into the capital P makes more sense at a player's Dungey.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,170
Yes.

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,770
All right.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,850
We need to go to routes and the route to here.

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:54,900
So I'm going to import then add edit and then players from that forward slash components forward slash

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,390
admen forward slash players and then at added players.

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:00,980
Right.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,570
So we need two main routes for this.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,680
You know the players with the ID and the players without the ID just like with it and match.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,370
So I'm going to copy this route and it closes and then paste this at the top.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,770
Of course now the round it's not admin at mattress it's going to be players.

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,860
And instead of here we will do instead of added match we could do players.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,660
Why not.

37
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,240
No again you can name this whatever you want.

38
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,620
Just going to name it at players the round on both could be added players in an edit match.

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,110
So this is kind of my mistake.

40
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,350
But don't don't worry.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,460
It's pretty much the same thing.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:48,480
So add players and the players with the needy and whenever we get this we will we will render the players

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,250
or of course nothing is going to happen because inside added players we don't have anything.

44
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:04,100
So we need to create a Riak class based component of course and it will be called at added players.

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,990
All right should be with a capital A.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,570
My mistake again.

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:07,870
All right.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,540
Inside players.

49
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,880
Going to do pretty much at the beginning.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,730
What we did with added mench So we're going to go to and match pretty much copy all of this imports

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,560
right here just to save time and I'm going to paste it down here.

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,110
All right.

53
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,600
So we are still needing the lay layout.

54
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,470
We fill in the form fields we need to validate.

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,390
So that's you know Stace.

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,660
And then of course we're going to do something right here.

57
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,810
We will maybe need the Firebrace Luper maybe not.

58
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,250
I don't think we're going to use it.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,460
And right here we are making reference to find the steam's.

60
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,210
We don't have teams right here.

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,550
It's just players.

62
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:51,570
So I'm going to bring bring the firebase them players you know the the export we created on the preview

63
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,290
section.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,290
So players just like this we will use firebase TV and find mismatches.

65
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,710
And we are not going to use it.

66
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,850
I'm going to bring firebase just firebase because again we're going to do some weird stuff right now.

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,900
So if you go to add a mattress the first thing we have is this state the big state.

68
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,810
So we are not going to use a lot of this.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,250
We're going to use a set of course but it's going to be pretty much it's going to be much shorter than

70
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,210
the other one you know the one we haven't at a match so I'm going to say first of course state we're

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,900
going to go here and I'm going to copy the first ones not the form data.

72
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,420
We're going to create this kind of a manually.

73
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,510
So we're still in need and Id remember this one.

74
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,330
This endpoint surfs the edit and the app.

75
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,520
So instead of match player id the form type you're still going to use the form type the form error the

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
form success and later right now makes no sense.

77
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,370
But later we're going to have a place where we can store the default images.

78
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,630
Remember that this one service kind of an edit and edit player.

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,410
So when the application loads it will try to fetch the image so it will be it will be stored inside

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,700
of default image.

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,400
And of course we're going to see this later.

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,130
Don't worry.

83
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,190
So teams will have teams.

84
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,820
All right.

85
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,970
So what we do have.

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,140
A form then data open and closed.

87
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,700
And then of course we need to create our you know list of inputs.

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,840
So I'm going to go to add and match and the first one was to date.

89
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go back to many players and I'm going to copy the date.

90
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,250
We don't have a date right here.

91
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,220
We have a name a last name a number and a position.

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,770
Right.

93
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,630
So we're going to start with name name.

94
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,490
The element is an input the config is going to be player name.

95
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,050
I wish there could be kind of a short way to do this but there's not.

96
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,890
So player name the date no name impaired.

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,740
And there's one type of chess text.

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,100
It is still required bounded false validation message nothing and show label is going to be true.

99
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,850
I want to show the label on this one so I'm going to copy this one pasted at the bottom and same thing

100
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,700
last name.

101
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:24,450
In this case and then player last and then name just like this.

102
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:24,890
Right.

103
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:31,270
And then of course last name impled last name impot still a type of text.

104
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,530
And we want to show the label.

105
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,890
Then of course we have the number pretty much the same thing.

106
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,250
So open close an input player number we can do number.

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,270
Right.

108
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,990
And then of course number employed.

109
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,710
And don't forget to change it right here number.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,350
And what else is still in in pre-text we could change it to number.

111
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,100
Doesn't matter right now.

112
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,700
We can do that no problem.

113
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,800
So instead of text you can put numbers just going to leave it in text right now.

114
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,200
So we have a show labeled of true everything else just pretty much the same.

115
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,430
So I'm going to copy this one and instead of couple thinks this one I'm going to go to add it to match.

116
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm going to search for the local because this is when he says Select and now we're going to be using

117
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,970
a select on the player.

118
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,780
So instead of local I'm going to put position.

119
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:31,030
The element is to select and select a and then position then instead of select locals select position.

120
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,340
Right.

121
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,360
Still as elect and again just like we did before this one is show level 2.

122
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,690
We could fetch a list of options from the server just like we did with teams but right here we just

123
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,060
have four different options.

124
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,910
So I'm going to make a space and I'm going to add them manually.

125
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,440
Remember that we have a key of something and then a value of something.

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,610
So coma and then value.

127
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,170
This is the way it works our you know reusable components for selects.

128
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,440
So for the key we have four positions.

129
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,420
So the first one is when he is going to be the keeper and to keep it simple I'm just going to use the

130
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,720
same.

131
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,940
So koma paste paste and then paste and never forget the comb.

132
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,590
So we have keeper then we have defense maybe you know nothing about soccer or football or whatever you

133
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,420
want to call it in your country.

134
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:31,630
So we have keeper defense midfield and I'm doing I'm being very short because inside you know the football

135
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,190
or soccer world you have a lot of different positions.

136
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,620
So midfield so inside of the same you know midfield you have different types of Midvale and different

137
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,300
types of defense.

138
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,810
So now I'm just cutting to the chase right here.

139
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,680
So we have a keeper defense midfield.

140
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,260
And then you know striker Vergon.

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,020
So this is the decisions later are we going to have we can add one more maybe in the next section which

142
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,440
is the image remember that we're going to be using just right here.

143
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,260
So we need a place where we can validate that we have the image and you know everything else.

144
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,890
All right.

145
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,050
So for now I'm going to delete this one.

146
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,070
The coma last coma.

147
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,800
Of course we need to add all of this to our hour render.

148
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,490
Right.

149
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,060
So again just like on the match let me just go right here.

150
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,150
We need the admin lay out.

151
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,770
Right.

152
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,110
So I'm going to go back to our end point and say I mean lay out.

153
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:41,360
So I got to wrap everything inside of a div and div the class name for this class name because to edit

154
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:49,890
players could be added players you know I just wanted to keep it simple not use a very long string dialogue

155
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,630
because of course you need to type more.

156
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,460
Just trying to type less.

157
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,430
So edit players dialogue dialogue and rapper.

158
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,420
All right.

159
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,400
So age to open and close and we say this not state that form type.

160
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,100
All right of course at the beginning we don't have a form type.

161
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,780
We're not going to get a form type.

162
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,160
But then of course we were going to get it after we make a request to check.

163
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,560
We have an ID.

164
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,420
So form and form right.

165
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:28,770
Whenever we submit the form Remember we want to call the on submit event handler on met and with this

166
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,150
unsafe meant we will catch the event just like this event.

167
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,830
And then of course we will run a function called this dot of Mitt and then form.

168
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,970
And of course I'm going to be passing the event for now maybe we're going to change it later.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,170
But for now it's just as good as it gets.

170
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:55,870
So again instead of here we could just start adding the the form feels good to go back to edit match

171
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,640
and I'm going to copy this one and paste it down here.

172
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,690
So the first form field I remember is going to be the name so form data and then this that state that

173
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,440
form data that name.

174
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,360
And we're still updating the form.

175
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,040
We're going to add this functions in a couple of seconds.

176
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,590
So you know what is kind of weird it's that I'm not getting anything because we should get something

177
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,900
at least.

178
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,040
So OK let me just Dolton why I'm not getting anything because I we should be getting something.

179
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,710
One sec.

180
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,330
All right sorry.

181
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,230
Sorry for this.

182
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,520
I know what the promise right here.

183
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,540
We're going to at being an ad player and the route it's at players.

184
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,320
If I go to the Napp of admen nav I'm pretty sure I made a mistake right here.

185
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,910
So players should be players.

186
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,130
That is the problem.

187
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,930
That it is getting weird.

188
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,530
So our players get what we get at least the name that is get.

189
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:51,810
All right.

190
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,750
Sorry for this.

191
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,960
So let me just go back.

192
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,970
So at edit players or it's going to go back here and we're going to keep doing this.

193
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,710
So first we added the name.

194
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,270
Now we need to add everything else.

195
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,750
We have a last name.

196
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,820
We have a position and a number right.

197
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:20,770
So copy paste and of course the first one it's the second one it's last name form data last name and

198
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,710
there we go get it.

199
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,420
All right.

200
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:36,440
Next one is going to be the numbers so Number of course number and then number kind of reloaded.

201
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:38,930
OK.

202
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,020
So now in the next one is going to be the position.

203
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,790
So copy paste.

204
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,450
And of course this one is going to be a case of select.

205
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:53,470
So we so you say position just like this and then form data position.

206
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,210
The application will reload and we get to select a position and all the positions.

207
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,450
So far so good.

208
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:05,150
I get to go back to an edit match and we're going to get all of this at the bottom so I'm going to copy

209
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,090
and paste it right here because it's pretty much the same code.

210
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,630
It's the exact same card.

211
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,440
All right.

212
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:21,060
So we reload and of course we have the button but we don't have anything because right now we don't

213
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,940
know what kind of form type Do we have.

214
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,770
All right.

215
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,770
OK so let's keep doing this right.

216
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,860
We know which forms that we have pretty much two main functions which is to submit form and the update

217
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,430
form.

218
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:42,570
Ryan this is pretty much standard so I'm going to go to match and I'm going to copy the one that says

219
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,070
update form.

220
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,160
This one it's pretty much similar.

221
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,480
So I'm going to copy this.

222
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,610
I'm going to paste the function right here and there we go we have it like it will be for the next project

223
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,950
you're going to do this in a different way so there's not going to be a lot of copy pasting because

224
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,030
you know copy pasting.

225
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,850
It's not always good.

226
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:02,740
All right.

227
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,750
So what else.

228
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,660
We have the submit form so we don't have that function.

229
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,570
I'm going to copy the serpent form and well there's a bit for me is something that we pretty much have

230
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,800
on all all the forms we use through all the occasion.

231
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,020
It could be much smaller or not.

232
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,110
So I'm going to delete whatever we have inside for me is valid here later.

233
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,670
No soup made for it.

234
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,890
All right.

235
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,140
Now all of this right now we are not going to need this.

236
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:38,400
We're going to delete this one and we're just going to keep this one which is where we add things to

237
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,120
the to the submit the data to submit.

238
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,930
That is when you need it.

239
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,780
And then of course we have the the marbles right here.

240
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,760
So again we're going to do this a million times.

241
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,890
We use this what else we have to submit for now.

242
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,560
And we have the update form.

243
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,820
So now whenever the application loads what I want to know I want to know what kind of form type do we

244
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,090
get.

245
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:07,400
No what we're going to do and this we do it by getting the ID so we don't have an ID that is an employer.

246
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,990
If we do have an ID is an edit player.

247
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,690
Right.

248
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,200
All right.

249
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,930
So let's do that right now.

250
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,680
First we need to do to of course to do it on the component at Mt..

251
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,520
So I'm going to go right here the top could be at the bottom doesn't matter.

252
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,030
So a component that mounts opening close.

253
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:33,960
So first we need to get to try to get the the player id so Konst player id player id is going to be

254
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,230
equal to this.

255
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,570
That props that match that per rams that idea.

256
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,090
All right.

257
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,520
Now of course on this one we are not going to get it.

258
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,970
So we ask we check if we do have a player id.

259
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,880
So if we don't then that player if not as a player are going to do all the logic for EDID play or later

260
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,630
right here you know the request to firebase and everything else.

261
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,250
All right.

262
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:08,580
So of course right now the only thing we get is this that said state opening close and we are going

263
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:14,530
to say that the form type it's equal to player.

264
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,100
So the application will reload and we're going to get at player.

265
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:25,560
So that is good of course if I do something we fail but if we type something at least it's updating

266
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,660
the form.

267
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,790
So so far so good.

268
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,810
We have four.

269
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,530
And later if everything is OK and we submit the form we should be getting a console log or something

270
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,910
with the data to submit.

271
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,770
But of course we need to do much more.

272
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:44,520
Now on the next section and this is maybe it is going to be this is what interest you is to me the player

273
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:52,470
image we're going to connect to the database and there's an image to the storage of your database project

274
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,510
your firebase project and you're going to use a third party library.

275
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,100
Don't worry it's already installed around.

276
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,670
So again we're going to do this and after we do this everything else you know the player name the last

277
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:11,310
name number and position it's going to be pretty much the same because we already did it on the other

278
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,460
forums.

279
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,450
So again we're going to do this maybe you want to learn you want to know how to do this.

280
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,600
And after you do this you can just go go to the final part maybe copy the code because you will need

281
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,440
to have the same code and that's it you know.

282
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,050
So after this we are not going to learn anything new.

283
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,900
We just need to do the standard work we do as a developer you know just doing a lot of that.

284
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,510
We do a lot of things many many times.

285
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,890
You know maybe the same thing.

286
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,590
All right.

287
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,760
So let's go to the next section and do the player image.

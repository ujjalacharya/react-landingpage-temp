1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,650
OK so now we get to create the edit match.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:09,340
This is the final one so we will grab the ID from the route from the right here the L and we going to

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,360
bring this from the server and populate everything.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,300
Now we're going to spend some time because we have a lot of inputs.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,250
You have a lot of fields and of course we need to do a lot of checking and you know it's going to take

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,640
some time.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,780
So if you want to get a coffee go and get a coffee maybe some cookies too.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,120
The cool thing about this is after we create the edit batch we can it create we can use the same disks

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,390
same exact exact components same file to add a match or to edit a match.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,660
It's going to be the same file.

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,650
So again we are just doing two components on one.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,080
All right.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,510
So first thing first if I click on this we don't really have a route for this so we need to create a

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,710
file and then a route.

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,770
So I'm going to go to matches and first I'm going to create the file.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,760
So I'm going to call it at edit and then match something like that.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,620
You can use whatever you want.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,650
And of course it's going to be re-act class based component.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,080
Oops sorry.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,330
There we go.

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:14,050
And I'm going to change the capital a to a very good so at it.

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,620
Matt For now doesn't matter.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,270
OK.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,260
So I'm going to go two routes and of course we need to put around for this.

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:28,130
So import and edit match.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,850
And it's.

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,570
It's going to be from opening closed that for Slash components for Slash.

28
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:41,570
We get the atman for large matches for Slash and add and match.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,660
And the route pretty much what we did right here just going to copy admen matches and of course we need

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,310
to add more things.

31
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,250
So we have two different routes.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,800
In theory we have the added patch and then we have the edit match by id the edit match is just going

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,000
to be the at match and you match.

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,050
So we are still entering edit match of matches.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,740
But this time it's going to be forced let me do it right here for Slash.

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,010
Then we access edit then match.

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,890
And if you check the your L after edit match we get the ID.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:24,610
So to pass dynamic IDs to to the to the re-act router we do for Slash and we need to use the colon and

39
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,250
then keyboard which is going to be the ID.

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,780
Right.

41
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,340
This is the way we catch you know dynamic values on the you are allied with reac router and of course

42
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,190
we need to pass the correct component added match.

43
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,950
So at the closes at match.

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,660
All right.

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,930
So in theory if I go right here you can enter this round and of course we get nothing because right

46
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,840
here we have nothing.

47
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,480
So we are loading the correct route.

48
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,370
OK.

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:03:00,250
So on a match we need to bring some things first we need to import the admin then lay out just like

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,590
this.

51
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,920
Been been layout from DOD for the DOD for Slash one more and one more.

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,280
And HBO sees an admin layout.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,970
Of course we need to wrap pretty much everything on admin layout and if it were load we get the bar

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,090
and at match.

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,700
Very good really easy.

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,980
Now of course we going to be working with forms.

57
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:30,320
So it's import and we will will bring for form just like this and then field I believe I call it fields

58
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,510
or fields.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,420
I'm not really sure.

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,680
Let me just double check form fields and we bring form field Singler form field.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,500
From that that force lasht that out for Slash.

62
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,750
And I believe it was you I for Slash and then form fields.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,450
What else.

64
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,110
Remember we use to validate.

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:04:00,410
So we bring Baali date from DOT for Slashdot dot for Slash you I for Slash misc.

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,820
And then of course we need to bring firebase but begin to do that much much later.

67
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,430
So far so good.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,180
Okay.

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,890
So now of course we need to handle the form through state and we can get a lot of things.

70
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,500
And I can explain you as we go.

71
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,050
So first whenever the application loads we need to check if we do have an ID it right.

72
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:30,100
If this is an edit or match so we could get a match ID so I'm going to create a state of match ID.

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,180
Of course this is going to start empty then we're going to get this much much later.

74
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,950
Now this form could be add or edit.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,430
So we need to know what form type.

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,710
So after we know the form type we can store it inside the state just like this.

77
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,110
And of course then we get the form error.

78
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,910
Just like before which is going to be false and then we're going to get a form success just like before.

79
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,630
Same thing we did before which is going to be empty.

80
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,670
And I got to add one more teams.

81
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,850
Why am I am adding adding teams.

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,530
OK.

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,510
If I go to the final one on the EDID match whenever we have to select a local in a way we have a list

84
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,080
of all the teams in the league.

85
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,770
Right.

86
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,740
So we didn't have that.

87
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,330
We didn't have that and we're not going to manually at this.

88
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,490
So what we're going to be doing we're going to be fetching this from the server because we have it right

89
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,460
here.

90
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,030
So teams and begin to fetch all the teams with thumbnail the short name and everything else.

91
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,280
So of course beginning whenever we fetched a list of teams we're going to store them right here because

92
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,590
we are going to need them.

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,480
OK.

94
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,120
They're going to do.

95
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,310
Oh sorry.

96
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,320
I'm going to do coma.

97
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:48,630
And the next thing is to form data just like this and no capital formed data.

98
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,250
This is going to be an object with many many objects inside.

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,970
All right.

100
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,590
That's good.

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,870
I'm going to say.

102
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,550
So the first thing we need is the event date and we're going to do it step by step no input by input

103
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,990
because they are kind of different so the first one is the date.

104
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,650
So first we say don't open and close.

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,460
We pass an object if you remember we use the element just like this element open and close and other

106
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,480
other think about it while typing all of this over again are going to go to a place maybe the sign in

107
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,820
where we have this logic inside the state that's called sign index.

108
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,310
I'm going to copy this one.

109
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,210
Now there's no need to type everything we just need to change some things.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
So this is going to be date.

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,660
The element is an input the value is empty and the config of course is going to be different.

112
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,420
The name is going to be date input.

113
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:53,410
That type is not an email is going to be a type of date and I'm not going to use a placeholder right

114
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:53,920
here.

115
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,890
It's not going to use it.

116
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:56,930
OK.

117
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,680
Now there's one more thing.

118
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,900
If we check the final one we can see that we have event date right here.

119
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,510
Right.

120
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:12,370
And I don't want to add that tag this event 8 whenever I declare the form field right now because we

121
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,910
need to do everything manually.

122
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:21,940
What I can do I can add a label property just like this and say that the label for this one event date

123
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:29,290
just like that this is a title Elater I could add to this a property called Show level.

124
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,840
So then we can evaluate if this show labels true or false so if this is true we're going to create a

125
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,530
label and add it to the form fill with it.

126
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,020
With this we don't have this behavior right now that's at.

127
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,660
Why not.

128
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,700
So we can actually see it.

129
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:52,540
So inside form fields of course right here we could check we could ask if we do have a form a show label

130
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,130
of two.

131
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:03,400
So are going to go and say OK do I have a form or form data form data that show level just like this.

132
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,380
And let me double check.

133
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,310
I will leave show label capital L..

134
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,470
I'm going to change his show label a show label of true.

135
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,860
Yeah.

136
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,170
OK.

137
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,820
So if we do please show a label.

138
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,930
If not.

139
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:18,890
No.

140
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,770
All right.

141
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:28,840
So what I'm going to do I'm going to just put a div with a class name off label input that exists label

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,950
input and he sort of hear whatever I have.

143
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,430
I get inside a conflict that level.

144
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:45,300
So I'm going to say open in close form data dot config dot levell.

145
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,040
All right of course we need to add this form field.

146
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:57,110
So I'm going to go back again to look in design and Im going to copy that impaired form field.

147
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,780
And we don't need any anymore for now.

148
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,610
So I'm going to go to an edit match and of course we need to do something a little bit better with this.

149
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,420
We need to add the title and everything else so for now we're just going to put it right here.

150
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,110
And then of course we can modify it.

151
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,390
So it's going to be date and this one date.

152
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,310
All right.

153
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:28,850
So if we check our code we get cannot read probably elements of undefined for data that elements AK

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,770
I may have made a mistake on this one.

155
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,850
All right sort of for that.

156
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,240
Actually everything was OK.

157
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,420
It was kind of weird.

158
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,490
I just removed that copy and paste it again.

159
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,450
It was working.

160
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,900
Sometimes the editor they add some strange characters and sometimes it doesn't works it doesn't work.

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,030
So you know that's kind of shitty behavior but it happens.

162
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,060
So it was OK.

163
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,600
So instead of Leavell input right here it's legal in it's script for that.

164
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,390
I'm going to reload the application and we get to the end date.

165
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,300
And of course we can enter a date.

166
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,530
And of course if we select the dropdown and this is the default behavior of the browser we can select

167
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,120
the date Burguet.

168
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:19,160
Of course right here this form field needs to be inside inside of a form and everything else so we're

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,560
going to do that right now.

170
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,170
For now just going to copy and remove it.

171
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,670
Going to add in a minute.

172
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,230
So we're going to add a dev off class name opening close.

173
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,450
And I look at this.

174
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:42,050
This class is at it just like this match underscore dialog dialog and then wrapper right.

175
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:48,180
We have an H2 tag which is pretty much the title and this one is going to be that this state that form

176
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,130
type.

177
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,730
Right.

178
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,180
Because if we go to EDID match this one the title should be added.

179
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,320
But if we go to add should be at.

180
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,970
So right now I'm going to put it right here.

181
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,140
It's going to be this that state that form type.

182
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,770
We didn't have that form type but we will get it in a few minutes.

183
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,120
Don't worry.

184
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,350
So of course out of here we need to add a div with the form inside.

185
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,160
So we're going to go and say form open and close Burguet.

186
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,500
Now the form just like before we have an on board note on men.

187
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,200
So the answer met and we did this many times before we have an event.

188
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,760
Events right.

189
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,100
Right.

190
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,400
Correctly event.

191
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:39,890
And then of course we run a function which is called this dot I've met form you can call this whatever

192
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,450
you want.

193
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,020
And of course we pass the event right.

194
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,110
There we go.

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,820
So now we can add our date wrapper.

196
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,230
Now a date field so date.

197
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,130
Very good.

198
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,800
Going to reload it and.

199
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,030
OK.

200
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,640
We get the data and it's pretty much similar Burguet.

201
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,330
So what else then instead of a date we need a local with all the teams and we're going to populate the

202
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,200
teams at the end after we have it pretty much the whole form.

203
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,010
So OK so now let's do it let's do the teams right.

204
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,550
OK.

205
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:26,180
So I'm going to go at the top just here date and I'm going to bed all the teams are going to copy date.

206
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,830
I guess I don't want to write all over again.

207
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,480
Can I copy and pasted at the bottom.

208
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,290
All right.

209
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,880
So this one instead of teams which just not teams is the local team.

210
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,940
Now the local and then the result we need to add local the first input is going to be local so local

211
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,680
instead of a on an input is going to be a select.

212
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,920
We didn't have a select.

213
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,330
We're going to create it right now.

214
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:58,270
So the config on the label could be on a no select just like select a local team.

215
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,490
Anyways it doesn't it doesn't matter.

216
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,470
Not going to use a local team the name.

217
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,200
Select local or something like that.

218
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:16,420
I don't know local the type is going to be a select and much much later we will load the list of teams

219
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,130
right here.

220
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,710
So I'm going to be adding on options and of course now when we create in select dynamic input we will

221
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,330
feed the options.

222
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,450
All right then the validation is now going to be e-mail true is going to be required and forgot to remove

223
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,620
it from here.

224
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,380
And we have you know just required is going to be bad and falls by the nation and everything else chose

225
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,020
the same.

226
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,920
But the show labeled this time is going to be false.

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,030
All right.

228
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,600
Now of course if we make a reference to this and if I copy this and paste it at the bottom and put a

229
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:59,110
local just like this and then look hole at the bottom I reload the application and nothing really happens.

230
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,720
And it's because on the form fields on this component we didn't have a select type.

231
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,410
We need to create right now.

232
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,830
So let's go to the next section and add the select form field.

1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,740
OK so let's create the file uploader of course this could be something you can every used throughout

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,420
the your whole application that's going to happen in this project.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,000
Maybe in real life this is going to be the case.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:19,250
So we're going to use a reusable components are going to go to you and create a file loader dodginess.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,290
Again you can call this whenever you want.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,020
So this one is going to be a re-act class based component.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:25,720
Right.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,120
And I'm going to give you the name of you know file uploader but with a capital F that's it just that.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,390
Or of course I'm going to leave this pretty much empty and we're going to do this later.

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,160
But first we need to do some things inside at the player's going to close the match for them.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,710
All right.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,350
So we need to import it right here on the top.

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:57,910
So of course we need to go and say import and then file uploader then from dot dot for Slash.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,130
One more time.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,040
You I.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,670
And then file uploader.

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,640
Now after we fuck up after we upload an image and everything else we can to store the image location

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,050
and everything else we can and need inside the form data right.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,770
Because when we submit something we need to store not just the data but the image inside storage but

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,620
the body of the image inside the database.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,140
Now let me go to storage.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,950
I'm going to get I'm going to get this.

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,470
Maybe you're going to get some different message something like get started.

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,620
And they're going to get you going to get a pop up saying that the default.

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,250
It's like everyone can read and then everyone can ride that is OK.

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,820
Then we will change them some rules.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,210
But for now that is OK.

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,880
So just click.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,020
Got it and it's going to take you to the screen.

30
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,690
OK.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,630
Going to go back to our project and go back here.

32
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,290
So we need to add a state of image.

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,650
And remember that inside form data before we submit something we need to check the validations.

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,130
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I will add to state for the image.

35
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,630
Now the state it's not going to be like this once it's going to be pretty much small.

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,440
So I'm going to say image just like this image opening close.

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:22,510
And we will have an element just like the other one element open and it's going to be image than coma.

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,850
And we do have a banlieue chest like the other ones.

39
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:31,020
Remember that this one's the important thing is the value and the validation.

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,540
Right.

41
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,790
OK so value for now starts at nothing.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,070
Then we have a validation just like here validation.

43
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,120
And it's going to be equal to.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,550
And we can make it required so we can do symbolization right here and at the beginning is going to start.

45
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,180
It's valid.

46
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:56,740
True because of course maybe at the beginning we want to you know the image is going to try to blow

47
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,870
something so we don't really want to change it.

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,530
We will get this we'll get there in a few minutes.

49
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,650
All right so now we are we have a state we have an image inside the state and we are importing file

50
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,340
uploader.

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,340
So we need to bring this component to the actual form.

52
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,900
Right.

53
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,500
All right.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,450
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to open and close now this file uploader needs to be mixed

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,250
to receive a lot of configuration from the parent component.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,050
So the first one and I'm going explain this and then explain what are the probs.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,990
Right now as we type them.

58
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,710
So first I'm going to say dead there and then.

59
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,030
Player or players.

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,280
Makes more sense.

61
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,080
So what is this there now after we upload something to firebase we need to store it inside of our directory.

62
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,530
If I don't pass it there is going to store them here on the route.

63
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,390
But I went to store them inside a directory called players you know a little bit better.

64
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,670
So when we abduct something and whenever we do an upload it will go to the player's directory.

65
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,880
That's why we use it.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,110
And this is something we of our own.

67
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:06,850
OK.

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,380
This is not something from the file uploader Ryan nothing at all.

69
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,850
All right.

70
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,930
So next prop is going to be takk.

71
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,300
Now let me show you the final one.

72
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,020
I'm going to go to players the players and show you this one.

73
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,790
This one is the final one.

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,410
So whenever we load the page we get the image.

75
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,390
So this is a div with a background image a little bit broken window because it's a small image.

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:42,220
When to use this low small images and the back in the background we have the image so we can render

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,410
this background and the remove and everything else from with.

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,870
Then the file uploader.

79
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:54,240
So what we need to do we need to pass some properties like the tag may maybe the you or l of that image

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,750
and some other properties.

81
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,590
All right.

82
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,310
So going to go to tag and I'm going to say player player image right.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,540
Makes sense.

84
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,690
So what does attack.

85
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,380
Is this.

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,170
We as this tag player name or play last night.

87
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,760
Does it attack.

88
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,810
Nothing really special.

89
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,810
Now again we will be using this to the add edit function i.v.

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,100
So we need to have a default image if the if we do have an ID and you know we have an actual image already.

91
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,350
So we're going to set a default image.

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,890
And if you remember inside the state right here at the top we have the default image.

93
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,830
So this is what we're going to be using.

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,430
It's going to go right here say default MGE and this one it's going to be equal to this that state that

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,990
default EMG.

96
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,410
Now we do have a name.

97
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,890
And again right now makes no sense but we will use it later.

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,420
So I can say that I want a default image just like the other one but this one is going to be named.

99
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,260
And later we're going to use this.

100
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,620
And this one instead of being equal to the default image it's going to be equal to whatever we have

101
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,220
inside the form data.

102
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,680
So there's that state that form data that image doesn't value.

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
Again we will go back to this.

104
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,510
Don't worry.

105
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,590
Now what happens if we upload an image just like this and we say no I don't like the image you know

106
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,420
is drawing.

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,500
I went to remove it.

108
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,060
So we clicked remove.

109
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,820
We will need a way or maybe a function or something that removes the image and give us back the the.

110
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,450
Let me go at players the file you know the file impot.

111
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,150
So our So we can create a function called Reset image.

112
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,870
Open and close and we don't have this function we created right now reset image opening close.

113
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm going to copy the name of the image and image a mistake.

114
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm putting this inside the form.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,290
Feel so sorry for that right here.

116
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,600
So we don't have this function going to create it.

117
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,120
And of course leave it empty right now.

118
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,370
Doesn't matter.

119
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,420
Could be a fine art function or just a function because we are using a class.

120
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,000
OK.

121
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,010
So we have a we said Image function.

122
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:19,770
So then just let's stop for one second and think what is going to happen after we upload the image.

123
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,360
So this component this player will not do any any uploading.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,420
We will do it from the file uploader.

125
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:35,320
So once they file the image gets uploaded from this component the server which is Firebrace will return

126
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,230
a set of names properties and everything else from the server.

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,770
And we kind of need that because inside of there we will have the name and the location of the image

128
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,490
and we need to grab the name and store it on the database on the player's document.

129
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:58,240
So this firebase uploader will be returning some data we need to use right here so we can update the

130
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,070
state.

131
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,710
Right.

132
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,350
OK.

133
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,950
So this is what this function is going to do.

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,830
I'm going to call it file name because the only thing we need it's the file name.

135
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:17,760
So again this file name will be passing up a prompt you know an argument called file name and then we

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:26,190
will we will use a function called store and then file name something like that store file late and

137
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,970
we will pass that file name.

138
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,180
We will get from the file upload or component.

139
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,440
We don't have this function.

140
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm going to go right here.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,410
Say this when it's equal to blah and there we go.

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,340
All right.

143
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,880
That is it.

144
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,270
We didn't have more props for now.

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,160
This is cool.

146
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,790
So now we need to go to File uploader and start creating the actual uploader.

147
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,130
Right.

148
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,370
So let's do that right now.

149
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,590
All right so let's start to build on this.

150
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,920
First we will need to use firebase because we're going to do an upload right here so we will need to

151
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,630
use firebase and it's from dot dot for slashed that thought forward slash and then firebase right.

152
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
OK.

153
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,880
So now just like I told before we will use a third party library for this.

154
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:18,040
And if we go to the package that Jason we have it right here re-act firebase file uploader.

155
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,870
OK.

156
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:27,590
So if I go to File uploader we need to import it so it's import and then file and then Kapilow you uploader

157
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,560
That's why we can use this one as it is.

158
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,530
So file uploader from that re-act firebase file.

159
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,880
Uploader all right what else are we going to use a circular or progress from a mature UI.

160
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,880
We have it right here at the top.

161
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,510
I guess not.

162
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,910
We don't like it.

163
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,960
We're going to do it.

164
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,070
So import.

165
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,550
And then it's called circular it's like this circular.

166
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:07,320
And then progress just like this and then from and if you remember it's not material you core we need

167
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,270
to add to the slash.

168
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,530
And then of course as the name progress right circle or progress Burguet.

169
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,640
So now on this file uploader we will have state again.

170
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,510
So the state is going to be very very simple we're going to have a name which is the image name if we

171
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,150
do have one the beginning and if we add the player we don't have anything.

172
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,660
Then we have a new problem calls a new volume called up.

173
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,830
It's uploading.

174
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,550
So if we are uploading that image to the server we will change this to true.

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,820
And we will show that circular progress of course since this is when this starts it's going to be false

176
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,300
because we are not uploading anything.

177
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,650
And then at the end we will get the u r l of the file you know the file you are.

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,840
And again we don't have this at the beginning.

179
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,850
It's going to show empty.

180
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,540
Now before creating the contents right here we want to get you know the default image.

181
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:10,190
If you remember right here right here we are passing a default image and a default image name.

182
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,740
Of course since we are adding players this ones are going to be empty but if we added player we want

183
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,960
to know if we do have a default image right.

184
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,680
OK.

185
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,540
So we're going to use something that we didn't use before.

186
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,640
I'm going to say it's static and it calls Gedor of state from prop's derived state from props.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,340
So this is actually something new from re-act 16 X or 16 6 or 5 or something like that.

188
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,090
So this one is going to you know it is going to load before everything gets loaded.

189
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,570
And when we see new props we want we want to change the state.

190
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,530
So the everything will be right we rendered with a new state.

191
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:49,990
All right.

192
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,430
So in this one we we see a problem which is going to be the next props and then the next take.

193
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,530
All right.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,130
So if opening close and I'm going to do a simpler and one more thing with this with this get derived

195
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,130
state from.

196
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,350
You always need to return something.

197
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,170
Right now I want it to return.

198
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,200
No but if something else this happens happens I want to return something else right.

199
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,440
Something else.

200
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,730
So what I want to check right here is if we have default images.

201
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:27,740
So if props which are the next props default just like this and I get a copy just to avoid mistakes.

202
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,710
Default image prompts.

203
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,850
If we do have a default image we want to start with a different state because now we do have a name

204
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,410
and we will have a file you are l.

205
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,460
Now the name is going to be whatever we have in default image.

206
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,990
And the other one defiled your.

207
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,700
Oh sorry it's going to be the default image name and the file you are l is going to be whatever we pass

208
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,080
to the false image.

209
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,020
So if I think about this just for a second we could use just one property with an object but you know

210
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,210
right.

211
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,120
You can you can do it if you want.

212
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,630
So OK.

213
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,900
So return and then state open and close and we will get expunged.

214
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,500
Right now we will return a name we will change the name on the state and the file you are Elb.

215
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:24,020
And again the default image name comes from Propst default image and then name because it's the name

216
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,030
and defile your L comes from props and default image just like this.

217
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,620
So whenever you use you use this they get derived state from prompts.

218
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,730
You always need to return something and whenever you return it's going to be applied you know to the

219
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,370
actual class or the actual class because we always use a class with this.

220
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:51,010
So in this case if this is not true we will return nothing but right here since this is true if we do

221
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,980
have an image it will return the new state.

222
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,110
So with this what it does is going to replace this state.

223
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,680
This one for this one right is going to remove this one and this will be the new state of course with

224
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,300
it is uploading.

225
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,050
All right.

226
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,390
So everything's good.

227
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,410
So I'm going to save it and find now we are good to go.

228
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,830
I'm going to go to our application and of course nothing happens and we get a lot of warnings but don't

229
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,350
worry.

230
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,580
So no.

231
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,590
I'm going to go right here at the bottom.

232
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,560
For now this part is done.

233
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,370
We need to add a lot of functions right here but we're going to need this first.

234
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,670
So inside of a div I want to add that file uploader know the input.

235
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,500
But the thing is that if we do have default images I don't want to add it since we have the device state

236
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,390
from prop's that it's managing this.

237
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:49,310
I could say opening close if we don't have it is that state that files you are l we want to do something

238
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,780
we want to play something.

239
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,140
If not we are going to display null for now.

240
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,390
All right.

241
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,730
So make sense makes sense.

242
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,430
All right.

243
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,850
So first if we do if we don't have a find you are all I want to show the file uploader.

244
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:11,360
So I'm going to start with Def opening cause now instead of inside of the div we will have a div with

245
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,410
the class name of a label and then input just like this.

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,210
And inside of here we can add the tack.

247
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,900
Remember we are using a tag.

248
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,650
So there's that Propst attack.

249
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,220
All right.

250
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,740
Very low the application our application you know we get player image.

251
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,260
So at least it works.

252
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,740
It's working.

253
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,090
So it's level impetus.

254
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:41,460
Sorry for that see it again and we get the player image stack so at least this is working this logic

255
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,620
and this is working or it could and we could do this on a different way of course but I wanted to use

256
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,010
a derived state from props.

257
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,570
Never used it before on this project so I want to use it.

258
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,330
All right.

259
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,870
So then we need the actual file uploader.

260
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,500
And when talking about file a bloater is the re-act firebase file uploader that component.

261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:11,530
So we have again a lot of props and this this ones are not props on our own this are default props.

262
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,370
You know we need to use from this developer right.

263
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,090
So first the first one we need to do we need to use it except.

264
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:27,490
So on this one we will specify what kind of images we want to accept if not of course it will return

265
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,130
an error.

266
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,980
So we and say image for Slash and I want to accept all for now again you can check the documentation.

267
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:43,360
If you go to rehab firebase uploader and very simple you know get have there you go re-act firebase

268
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
uploader.

269
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:52,090
So you get all the configuration right here start fresh file name so you get all the documentation and

270
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,070
you can check this out later.

271
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,370
All right let's go back.

272
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,520
So first we get the except then we have a name which name again we need to present it as the default

273
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,160
doesn't care much.

274
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,880
Right now it's just a default name.

275
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,670
So I'm going to say image we can do something else either way.

276
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,450
So what we can do when we have a property and we could not use it.

277
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,070
But I'm going to use it cause I run two miles just like this randomise and then file name.

278
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,220
So what it does it creates a random file name.

279
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,940
And this one will be stored inside firebase.

280
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,220
All right.

281
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,010
We have value for this.

282
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,630
If you put this is going to do the run.

283
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,770
If we don't put as the put this is not going to do it do anything.

284
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,620
All right.

285
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,860
So then we need to specify define uploader where we want to store images.

286
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:49,570
We spoke about this previously and we said that we want to store everything inside the player's directory.

287
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,100
All right.

288
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,800
So I'm going to say storage just like this storage and then ref.

289
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,160
And this is equal to something we are going to use.

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,330
Firebase DOD we access the storage.

291
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,080
And this is the way we accessed firebase is torture by using this.

292
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,040
And just like we did with the databases we pass a ref remember just like we did with firebase right

293
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,730
here at the bottom right here database.

294
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,640
And then we pass a ref.

295
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,900
Now the only difference is that now we are using storage.

296
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,590
All right.

297
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,460
So file a bloater and BRAF and do we have a ref for this.

298
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,080
Well yes we have it.

299
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,980
We have this inside the door you know the directory of where we want to store it.

300
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:39,820
So we say this that prompts that there are right now we have three more things and right now this one

301
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,530
went too long the section and we are going to put it right now and then we're going to go and do it

302
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,960
do this create disfunctions.

303
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,280
So by default would file uploader you have a lot of functions.

304
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,590
A lot of callbacks but I'm going to use just three.

305
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,520
So we have the first one because just because it's an upload which name it's upload starred and that's

306
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,990
when of course it's we need to do something with this.

307
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:11,620
So whenever the upload starts with this method will kick in and you know whenever you get this method

308
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,070
kyndes you can do whatever you want right here.

309
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,400
You can just trigger your own function.

310
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,110
We have the same idea on upload and then error.

311
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,670
So if we if you do have an error we do have an error.

312
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,810
We will just do something right here and then we have of course an upload.

313
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,470
Same thing but instead of air it's going to be success.

314
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:40,690
So after you upload the images and everything goes OK this upload success is going to trigger whatever

315
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,300
you put right here.

316
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,950
So I'm going to do.

317
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
And we didn't have this functions.

318
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,960
We to create this in a minute.

319
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,230
We're going to do this.

320
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:55,720
Handle handle and then upload and are going to copy this because it's the keyboard word and I'm going

321
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:10,270
to say start and then this DOD handle upload error and then does this that handle upload and success

322
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,280
of course.

323
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,170
All right.

324
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,770
So pretty much don't we don't have these functions.

325
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,560
So let's go to the next section and start creating the functions to do the actual uploading.

1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,350
All right so let's keep moving forward.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,770
Right now we only have matches and at match so we need to do pretty much the same process with players.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,260
And then of course at players now add players it's a little bit special because we haven't done a lot

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:21,190
of inputs but we have an input you know upload image and we're going to be uploading images to firebase

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,890
distortion there for free.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,920
But first we need to get the players.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,610
So just like here we have a list of all the players and this comes from the database from the right

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,700
here database.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,990
We have a place where we have all the players of me just show you of course you can go to your database

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,030
and check it out.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,540
So inside teams we help players.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,490
All right.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,120
So OK so going to go back.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,560
I'm going to go back to our project and of course we don't have a players and pointone going to go back

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:59,350
to our project inside admin to save players and this one just like the mattress will have an index that

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,720
Jay is going to create re-act class based component and the other one was at mismatches.

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,370
This one would be at player's right makes sense.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,570
I mean players.

19
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,170
All right.

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,490
So now we need to import this round.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,820
We don't we didn't have this round.

22
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,810
So we need to declare that.

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:26,440
So inside of routes we're going to go import at main players from that for Slash components at men and

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,740
then you know players since it's an index we don't need to bring anything.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,390
Now we already have an index for Aben matches so I'm going to copy this route.

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:41,110
The closest I going to pasted right here are the top and I'm going to say are we going to use Disk admin

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,560
players component whenever we go to admin players.

28
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,510
Right.

29
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:54,280
So in theory if I reload the application and I go to players we get up pretty much nothing but you know

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,960
it is there.

31
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:03,460
Let me just show you just to make sure I'm going to remove the hair and get the players spoke out.

32
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,440
So I'm going to open this and I'm going to bring the index matches because you know what we're going

33
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,370
to be do around we're doing right here.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,380
It's pretty much similar of what we did right here.

35
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,560
So I'm going to copy all of this because we are going to need the same same thing.

36
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,160
They're going to paste it right here at the top.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,010
So again we're not going to be learning anything you write doing this right here so we're going to you

38
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,120
know just copy some things are going to copy this one as well.

39
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,340
The fire base and we're going to change something inside of there.

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,050
But we're going to change it in the nick of minutes and just like the mattress we see we have a state

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
and it's loading.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,820
Sorry for that sorry.

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,210
I got a copy of the state and I'm going to do the same thing just paste it here.

44
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,450
All right.

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:49,990
What else.

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,550
We have a component did mount.

47
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,720
I'm going to copy the component mount and I'm going to put it right here.

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,960
We are now going to use this.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,390
I'm going to delete it and do it again.

50
00:02:59,490 --> 00:02:59,730
So.

51
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,140
OK.

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,100
So the first thing we need to do if we think about this is that we need to fetch the list of players

53
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,730
right here fetch fetched matches.

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,440
So right here we will be fetching the players.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,130
Now we don't have a of fire based players.

56
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,060
We have a firebase matches.

57
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,840
So if you go to firebase we have firebase D-B matches promotion teams.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,030
We don't have a reference to players.

59
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,060
So first we want to add it.

60
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,450
I'm going to do this and say Konst firebase.

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:41,420
And then players it calls to fire firebase TV dot ref opening close and I'm going to call it players.

62
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,280
Right now I'm going to export this so we can add it from different file.

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,840
All right.

64
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,990
I'm going to copy the name.

65
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,550
I'm going to go back to players.

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,230
So now instead of matches we're going to bring players real simple.

67
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,440
Now we need to pretty much do what we did on the other one.

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,190
So first we make a reference to firebase players than we do with the ones and we bring the value.

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,620
And of course then we begin to get a promise back.

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:19,590
So we open and close and we run something on this Colback you know this then we will receive a snapshot.

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,280
Right.

72
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,930
All right.

73
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,740
Snapshot just like with before we're going to get the information.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,100
In a weird way from from firebase so I'm going to say Konst players and I'm going to use the firebase

75
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,850
Luper.

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,940
We had the top at this point at all this at least like I don't know three four times.

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,070
So this one should be very clear.

78
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,950
So we're not going to do this that said state opening close and we're going to say it's loading we're

79
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,360
going to change to it's loading we're going to add it in a couple of minutes.

80
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,090
We're going to set it to false.

81
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,610
And then of course since we have a list of players we're going to say I want a list of players just

82
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,360
like this.

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,510
And if we want it is completely up to you.

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,580
You can do the reverse array just like with that before you know there's no need to do this because

85
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,660
there is no date related.

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,240
But again we're just going to put everything Canfor backwards.

87
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
All right.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,110
So I'm going to go right here and say console log is that state.

89
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,680
All right.

90
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:31,560
So if I loaded and I go to the console so we get OK so we get the loading.

91
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,510
Maybe the mattress does not right.

92
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,480
Made a mistake right here.

93
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,390
It's not mattress it's players.

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,480
Let me do it again.

95
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,390
And that's what you get.

96
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,260
You know my copy pasting.

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,200
So OK.

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,020
Players and we get the players know inside of the players on each player.

99
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,370
We have a Nimptsch going to see this why we're going to change this in a little while and then we have

100
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,760
the ID when they have the last name then the name the number and everything else.

101
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,200
All right.

102
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,600
OK.

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,450
You know that.

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,450
Let's get.

105
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,400
So am I going to close it for now and I'm going to go back here.

106
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,640
So we need to pretty much.

107
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,310
We need to pretty much create all the same layout with it with matchups.

108
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,240
Right.

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,460
We need first the admin layout so I'm going to copy of layout and no I'm going to do simple.

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,660
I'm going to copy this going to copy pretty much the whole thing.

111
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,640
Copy and paste it.

112
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,280
I told you we were not going to do a lot of things right here.

113
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,420
Nothing new.

114
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,190
So I'm going to copy and paste it right.

115
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,490
Of course we need to change some some things.

116
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,520
The properties are not the same.

117
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,110
We need to change the properties.

118
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,490
And of course the same thing with right here at the table head.

119
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,850
So first we get a first name.

120
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,960
Let me add it.

121
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,940
It's first and then name right.

122
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,320
Then we have a last name.

123
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,650
So last name and then we have a number what else.

124
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,490
We have a position.

125
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,640
All right.

126
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,750
So OK.

127
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,940
So if we go to the table body we're not going to be looping matches this this doesn't exist.

128
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,650
So we say players right here.

129
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:19,190
Does that state that players and we're going to map over the players and on each iteration we will be

130
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,450
getting getting a player right.

131
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,960
All right.

132
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,190
So what else we need to do quite a few things right here.

133
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,050
So on the table cell the first thing is going to be the first name.

134
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,550
So we don't really want a date right here so I'm going to do this and we're going to do it pretty much

135
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,440
all the other things because we are not going to use them to do something new here.

136
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,850
So inside a table cell.

137
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,620
What I want to do when you make a reference to the name and of course I went to add a link so we can

138
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,480
go to Edit the player.

139
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,200
So link to equals.

140
00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:00,020
Open and close and they're going to close the link and I don't know why against knocking me out cause

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,990
you know to complete tag.

142
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:10,830
So link of course we can to beat up putting the player that name and the two and this one is actually

143
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,310
that we don't have so far.

144
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:21,420
It's going to be forward slash Ming underscore players players then for Slash.

145
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:28,090
It's going to be ad underscore players for Slash and we need to pass the ID.

146
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:37,000
So then on this component we can fetch the ID and you know make the changes so player Donte ID.

147
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,220
All right.

148
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,790
So I'm going to I'm going to copy this and same thing right here.

149
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:47,160
But it's going to be a player last name last name.

150
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,780
All right.

151
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,640
What else.

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,460
We have the player number.

153
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,960
All right.

154
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,030
This one is real simple.

155
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,680
Nothing special in this one.

156
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,730
We're going to say.

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,980
Player number and the last one is the position again nothing special.

158
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,280
Player and then position and that is it.

159
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,330
We're still getting the signal the progress is loading and everything else is just the same.

160
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,490
So if I save it I can reload the application.

161
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,590
And if we go to admin players and we are already at big players let me close the console.

162
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,760
We get it you know we get all of the list of players.

163
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,180
So the zent if I go to Sergio Aguayo admin at players and of course we're still getting the ID.

164
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,580
So now we're going to create this end point.

165
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,160
All right.

166
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,030
So let's go to the next one and start with the players.

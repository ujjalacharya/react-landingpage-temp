1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,050
All right so what is the first thing we need to add.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,380
We need to add a route.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,960
Right now we are going to the act we are specifying right here specifying that we want an ID whenever

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,270
we go to EDID match.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:20,370
So in this case if we only go to private route and then of course just Ed match no I.D. We want to render

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,720
the match which is pretty much symp component.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:31,680
So OK so right now we are just passing outmatch at a match.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,110
And it's the same component.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,140
We don't need to create a new component for this.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,790
All right.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,000
So I got to go to add.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,290
Imagine going to reload the application.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,720
And if I go to outmatch Well I'm try again.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,320
Going to go to match and you know we can it get it like this.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,660
Of course we need to do some more things right here.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm going to go to at match and remember that whenever we do the component that Mount we are running

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,260
some things we are getting the matches and everything else.

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,390
But the thing the thing that gets the matches and everything else in all the time all the time and everything

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,130
else is this and we are doing it right here.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,070
But we are not doing it right there you know.

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:20,710
So we need to do it we need to trigger this get teams functions but maybe with different arguments.

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,150
Right.

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,680
So what we would do we would grab this get match get teams and I'm going to run it.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,850
But this is going to be false just like this.

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,280
False and that type instead of added It's going to be Utt match.

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,050
Right.

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,290
So now we're going to go to this function and this function will do whatever it needs to do and it will

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,260
be passing this type and the you know and match.

29
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,030
And this is false and the type is going to be at match at match.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:56,590
And if we go to update fields same thing you know we just update the state whatever we need to update

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,730
and from now does it.

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:06,670
Of course relo the application we get at match Nothing gets you know pre-populated.

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,940
The only thing we get is just teams.

34
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,050
And the other option is of course as well and we get the match as a button.

35
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,140
Right.

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,240
So now the only thing we need to do is to do the firebase request right here.

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,950
Right.

38
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,650
Or we go right here.

39
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,740
So if the form type it's at match we of course do this if not begin to push a match We're going to store

40
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,550
a new match on firebase.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,920
All right.

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,550
So we're going to delete this.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,060
We don't need it and we can use the firebase matches.

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:48,430
We have at the top of firebase and then matches that and to push new elements to kind of an array of

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,380
objects between coats I'm going to say push and what we push is whatever we get from data to submit.

46
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,930
And then of course we get a promise this when it's going to be real simple then.

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,100
And of course we do something.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,630
And of course if there is an error we catch something.

49
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,760
So e open close if we have a there's that said State Farm.

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,380
True.

51
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,380
If everything is OK what are we going to do.

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:26,010
I'm going to say this that props that history that push open and close and we're going to go to forward

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:36,880
slash at matches men underscore matches so we can redirect the user back to the matches.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,300
Remember the mattress is going to be this one.

55
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,710
All right so let's try and let's let's let's see what happens.

56
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,600
OK.

57
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,980
I'm going to select the date.

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,190
It's going to be today's date.

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:55,510
So it's going to be Brighton against Manchester City Of course.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,850
So Brighton 0 Manchester City to the referee or whatever.

61
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,930
Marcus fried the stadium Shark Tank arena whatever the team were sold.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,450
They won and the game played well.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,340
Yes they played it already.

64
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,800
All right.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,450
So remember Brighton Manchester City to nil and at a match.

66
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,750
We go back to the to this and we get Manchester City right on to new and it's a final it's final game

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,950
is final.

68
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,120
It's a very good man.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,890
Everything works.

70
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,500
All right.

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,320
So there's no really really simple.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,860
It took us a long time to do the at the edit match but you know it since is the same component and we

73
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,200
use the same logic.

74
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,140
Why not doing everything in one place and not creating two different files with pretty much the same

75
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,170
logic kind of make sense.

76
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,870
All right so now we have the matches.

77
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,500
The next thing we're going to be doing.

78
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,530
It's going to be the players you know add players and you know it's pretty much the same thing than

79
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,090
this one let me show you on this.

80
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,090
So we have players who have a list of all the players.

81
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,770
And then of course we add the players.

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,300
So the the impetus for this one the form can be real simple.

83
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,060
You know the name last name number and a position which is defense midfield or striker.

84
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:26,020
The interesting thing about this one which might interest you is the ADD file to store the file We're

85
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,150
going to upload a file to image the actual image to the hosting.

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,910
None of the storage inside firebase and that's going to be interesting.

87
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:43,740
So let's go to the next section and start doing the players section first and then we will go and add

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,240
players.

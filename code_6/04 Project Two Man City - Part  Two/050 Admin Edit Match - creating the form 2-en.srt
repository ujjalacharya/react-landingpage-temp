1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,980
OK so let's add the select type to form fields so we need to go to form fields and we need to add a

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,800
new case.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,760
Brian Right now we just have input type input case.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,100
Right.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,050
So case open and close.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:22,380
And then this time we need to put select or row of course we do a column and never forget to do a break

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,570
right.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,200
So inside select just like with it before we select the form table for template and then this is equal

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,940
to you know some GSX code.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,630
All right.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,110
So the GSX code of course we need to put a div and things just like with it before right here.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,770
And the formula all going to be the same song and it copy the form level and I'm going to paste it down

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,180
here.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,200
There is no need to you know type everything again.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,210
So after this we need to put this this is going to be select just like this.

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,780
And of course opening close.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,020
Now under select Of course we need to pass the value and the On Change just like with that right here

18
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:10,450
and there is no need to put the config right now on the Select because we just add value in on change.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,070
All right.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,890
So form data equals Tuvan the value is going to be equal to form data value and the onchange event is

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,770
the same onchange event.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,240
Now the only difference right now is that inside of select We have options.

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,840
So OK so the first option is going to be always the empty so option equals of sorry.

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,930
Option value equals nothing.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,490
And this one is going to be the default one.

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,110
Select one.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,850
And of course on this one you can do whenever you want.

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,230
You can put a default.

29
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,180
You can put you know maybe not one with the value but a disabled one.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,220
This is completely up to you.

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,980
Now the important thing is that the next options are the ones that are going to be rendered.

32
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,550
Depending on what we have inside the options right here.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,490
So what we need to do we need to enter that form data.

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,240
Dot com fiqh dot options dot and we need to do a map.

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,370
And of course I'm going to say item because on each iteration we will return some GSX and what we will

36
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,600
be returning is just an option.

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,470
Just like this opening close with the key.

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,390
Remember to add a key if not begin to get no 50 are warnings so item that key.

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,120
Because we do get a key from the server.

40
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,910
And of course a value so value equals item dot key.

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,520
All right that's good.

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,080
What else.

43
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,790
We have the item value.

44
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,290
So the value again is going to be the key which is the actual ID going get to see it later.

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,140
Don't worry.

46
00:02:53,490 --> 00:03:00,240
So item that value which is the name of whatever we want to input.

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,870
Now with data from the server in this case the teams comes in a weird way.

48
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,330
So whenever we fetch this we need to modify it to fit this description to have a key and a value.

49
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,780
Now the key could be whatever on a D.

50
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,270
Or maybe the same as the value depending on what we want to use.

51
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,580
But we only passed two form config options to this property.

52
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,560
A key and a value.

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,660
All right.

54
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,060
Again we will see this later.

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,640
At the end of the input we have a show error so at the end of the Select we will get the same thing.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,470
Now if we check our components of course cannot read property map of undefined.

57
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,710
Because of course we don't have anything on the other option.

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,730
Right now we don't have anything.

59
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,750
So inside the option actually options options that we get.

60
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,460
Anyways we shouldn't be getting anything at all.

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,490
At least we didn't get an error.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,670
So we get the first select one so that is OK.

63
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,890
So now for example and let me just give you an example.

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,250
I have it ready right here.

65
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm going to show you just give a second or second so there we go.

66
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,680
At the end when we get the teams going to get something like this this is an example from a different

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,850
input the way.

68
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,880
So we have a key you know an array of objects with a key and a value.

69
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,710
In this case yes but for now we have here we are getting good teams.

70
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,380
So it's going to be the name of the team or the ID right.

71
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,750
And then of course the name of the team which is always a key and a value.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,300
This could be whatever name.

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:46,110
This is completely up to you but if I save this and go to our application then go we are going to get

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,020
this populated with just yes and no.

75
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,580
This is the body you and whenever we select that we select that the key of course everything fails because

76
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,110
we don't have the update form function but begin to be adding this later.

77
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,490
Of course we don't need this later we are going to populate this options with the actual teams.

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,530
So now we're going to be just going to just move forward.

79
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,130
Now we need to add the select one and then we can get the results.

80
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,110
You know when you we typed a number right here it's going to be the result so we're get to need to do

81
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,530
that.

82
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,960
Let's do it right now.

83
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,050
The result is just an input.

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,410
So I'm going to copy the date property right here and paste it at the bottom.

85
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,920
All right so the result is going to be for the local So this is local.

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,760
So the key value for this result and then local right.

87
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,680
So the element is going to be just an input just like before this one.

88
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,260
Result local local and the name lits.

89
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,020
I don't know resoled underscore local input make sense now.

90
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:02,120
The type is going to be a text validation just required the botted false validation message empty.

91
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,070
And we want to hide that label false.

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,740
So now we have the local and the resoled local because it's going to be this one and then the value

93
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,910
of this one and we have kind of a special layout right here.

94
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,300
So we get a need to do it.

95
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,530
OK so I'm going to go at the bottom I'm going to put this make some space and begin to create the layout

96
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,350
for this.

97
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,770
So it's very simple and begin to use it later as well.

98
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,150
So dev open and close the class name is going to be.

99
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:39,970
Select just like this select underscore team and then lay out any set up here.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,070
We will add that level manually.

101
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,390
That's why we put a show label of false.

102
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,700
So class name label inputs or inputs.

103
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,850
There we go and this one is going to be local Ryan.

104
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,810
Then we have the way which is pretty much the same thing we are doing right now.

105
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:05,920
So then dev will add a class name of wrapper and inside of the wrapper we have two sections.

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,920
The one in the left and the one in the right you know left and then right.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:20,320
All right so the first step inside the wrapper has a class name off left so left and then of course

108
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:27,550
we have the right one which has no class in this case so the first field is going to be this one form

109
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,610
fields Burguet the first one it's going to be the local right that we need to add the other one which

110
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,140
is the result.

111
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:43,410
And salt local So its result and then local and this one resoled local same.

112
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,910
Same name has to match name and one more thing.

113
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,510
This key This name has to be the same one we have on the database.

114
00:07:52,510 --> 00:08:01,390
So if you go to players it's resoled local capital L because if we change the names right here later

115
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,180
when we send the data to the database the information to the database we will have to rename all the

116
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,140
tax to match.

117
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,950
This one's all right.

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,420
So if I save it and check a check file you're going to get it no local.

119
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,420
And then you know right here.

120
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
The actual value.

121
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,020
All right let's get.

122
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,330
So now we need to do the away I go to this one.

123
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,300
We have a.

124
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,190
Which is pretty much the same thing.

125
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,900
All right let's do the away one and again same thing.

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm going to copy local and we sold local.

127
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,120
Just going to copy everything and paste it down here at the bottom instead of local.

128
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,350
It's going to be a way.

129
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,930
And the other one resold away right away.

130
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,320
So this actually was the difficult part of this.

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,600
Now everything is going to get a little bit easier.

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,450
So I'm going to go right here.

133
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,380
Copy this one.

134
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,970
Paste it at the bottom and instead of local a way forfeit from field away.

135
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,570
All right.

136
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,340
Same thing right here.

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,890
And on the result local It's going to be resold away.

138
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:24,860
Same thing here away whoops result away or so my reload the application we get local in a way.

139
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,330
All right.

140
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,690
So everything for now it's ok.

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,530
After a local New way we get the information of the you know the referee which is just an input text.

142
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,550
The stadium again impot text.

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
And then of course we get the team we solve.

144
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,430
So let's do the referee referee and the stadium.

145
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,740
And those ones are going to be really really simple.

146
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,510
There are Cheston pretext they're going to copy the date they're going to trim this because these are

147
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,810
competing too much space and I don't like it.

148
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,430
So after we sold away we have the what do we have.

149
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,400
The referee was the stadium.

150
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,210
We have the referee.

151
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:02,740
OK.

152
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,770
So it's going to be referee just like this referee.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,330
And again it's just an empty text so input instead of event date.

154
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,200
I could put I a referee makes sense.

155
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,110
All right.

156
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,060
What else.

157
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,670
Referee input.

158
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,890
And the type is going to be in a type of text validation.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,370
It's required to be not required doesn't matter and the show Leavell and this one is going to be true.

160
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,610
Then we have the stadium.

161
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,820
So I'm going to copy the referee and paste them here and say it's Tatum.

162
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,490
All right.

163
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,070
So again on the stadium.

164
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:54,030
Same same logic stadium instead of referee impaired stadium.

165
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,860
The type of text and everything else is just the same.

166
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,450
Very good.

167
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,550
So now let's create the levels for this.

168
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:02,900
So.

169
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm going to go at the bottom right here and we are almost done with this.

170
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,960
And if you notice the final one has this line.

171
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,110
So this one it's wrapped in a diff.

172
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:19,700
So Dev and class name off split or split fields.

173
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,600
All right sort of here again.

174
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,260
Copy the form field.

175
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:31,170
After you read the first once everything else is just a little bit easier just the way it works.

176
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:38,880
So if you ask me what is the thing I hate the most about you know being a developer.

177
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,500
It's forms.

178
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,860
I hate them I don't know why but they are so useful.

179
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,430
And of course if you get a kind of I like let me copy this one into the stadium.

180
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:00,470
If you get kind of like a project where the user needs to buy something on e-commerce then you can do

181
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,730
a lot of form fields stadium.

182
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,580
Very good.

183
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,350
All right.

184
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,700
Almost done.

185
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,770
Referee and of course we need to change this.

186
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,040
So I made a mistake right here.

187
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,710
It's going to be stadium.

188
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,600
All right.

189
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,470
So referee and the stadium.

190
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,300
All right.

191
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,400
Very good.

192
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,850
There it is.

193
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,390
We are not doing the right here.

194
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,240
The place holder.

195
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,680
We could totally do it.

196
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,580
No problem.

197
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,180
So what is next.

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,620
We have the team with salt and the detail in the game played.

199
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,890
So this one's our select.

200
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:43,850
So we need to do something else with this once stew the last two which is which are the results and

201
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,870
the game play you know the team was sold and played very good.

202
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,850
So they are select.

203
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:57,910
So I'm going to copy maybe the local which it's a select syndicate copy this one trim it again and trimmed

204
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,270
the referee and the stadium and go to again right here.

205
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,810
OK.

206
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,880
So this one it's result.

207
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:17,110
So again it's going to be a select and instead of this team result or results no result.

208
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:26,530
So right here select local No select result and it's going to be a select require true validation falls.

209
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,700
And I do want to show the labels are going to say true.

210
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:38,330
Now on the options what we need to do we need to pass some options like Tim resoled so win lose draw

211
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,290
and not available.

212
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,300
So why are we doing none of evil.

213
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,430
Maybe this game the one we are entering right now.

214
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,630
It's in the future so when the team never played this game so the info it's going to be not available.

215
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,450
So we are going to be passing four different options with the key just like I told before with the with

216
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,880
key.

217
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,960
And of course of value just like this in this case devalues the same name that the key.

218
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:12,860
So of course we get when it's coma we get loose we get a draw and then we get none of it.

219
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,690
Right.

220
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:30,510
So coma coma coma that we get lose lose then we get a draw then draw and then non available non available.

221
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,150
OK so let's make of revenants up you know this.

222
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,800
And it's going to be the same thing.

223
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,790
This we have a split field.

224
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,640
So I'm going to split split fields and this one says it's the last I'm going to add an additional class.

225
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm going to skip the last line right here at the bottom.

226
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
So of course we get the same thing on this one.

227
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,990
For now I'm just going to delete it and this one it's the results I believe we call this results or

228
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,830
we sold.

229
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,670
Not really sure.

230
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,420
Result.

231
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,610
Very good.

232
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:08,590
So result and then result if we reload the application.

233
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,970
All right we get team result and then we win lose draw and none available.

234
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,570
Right.

235
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,050
So we have one more to go.

236
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,260
Thanks.

237
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,190
Luckily one more to go.

238
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,730
And it's the final.

239
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,380
Right.

240
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,260
So again same as result.

241
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,700
It copy in to trim and you're going to opes I'm going to paste it right here at the bottom.

242
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,150
Sorry for that OK.

243
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,360
So this one instead of result will be final.

244
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,310
Final.

245
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:37,990
All right.

246
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:45,460
Still select and then game played and game played like that.

247
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:53,050
So select is going to be you know maybe played select play type of select and the options are going

248
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,490
to be a little bit different.

249
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,690
I did a little bit different.

250
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,220
Now it's yes or no.

251
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,500
So the key the first one it's yes and devalue.

252
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,210
I'm going to choose.

253
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,000
Same thing as could be an ID maybe a zero or a true or false.

254
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,550
But to keep it simple I'm going to put just yes or no.

255
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,860
All right OK.

256
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,610
We're almost done and we are still showing the level just like the other one.

257
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,520
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and select the form fields.

258
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,600
And this one it's final.

259
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,820
Final.

260
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,430
And then finally again.

261
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,960
All right.

262
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,180
So let's see.

263
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,470
So we get team results with yes and then yes and no forget.

264
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,090
So everything works.

265
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,900
Of course we need to add a Bunim.

266
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,970
So let's do it right now before going to the next section.

267
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,510
And I'm going to add all the things because we can it did this.

268
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,530
So first we have the success level remember.

269
00:16:52,570 --> 00:17:00,250
So we're going to do class name success underscore label and on this one we can output whatever we get

270
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,820
back from this.

271
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:10,410
Does that state and I'm going to close this go from this dot state DOT form success.

272
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,980
All right what is next.

273
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,690
What happens if we get an error.

274
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,180
Of course we're going to make a reference to this that state that form error.

275
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,140
All right.

276
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,690
And if this is true we're going to output.

277
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:33,560
You know maybe with an error so we're going to say Divx opening close and class name of error.

278
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,980
Levell I know that this is rather boring but we're almost done.

279
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,740
So close to finished this part.

280
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,200
The next thing is going to be a little bit more entertaining.

281
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,400
So wrong.

282
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,480
Right.

283
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,620
And of course we get no errors.

284
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,430
We're not going to display anything at all.

285
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,380
Now we need to add a button and this one it's a little bit different.

286
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,530
I'm going to wrap this up on a dip so adman underscore so met.

287
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,960
This is the class of course.

288
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,350
Inside we add a button.

289
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,540
All right we need to add an unclick so on.

290
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,890
Click.

291
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,410
Just like this.

292
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:23,530
And what we will do the same thing then before we need to catch the event event and then does that submit

293
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,130
form and we pass the event.

294
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,990
We didn't have this function of course and instead of here.

295
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,060
We need to output our team at match or edit match.

296
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,620
But we don't know that yet.

297
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:43,510
So for now we're just going to put this state that form type OK.

298
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,400
Of course we are not going to get anything on the button but we will get something at least.

299
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,010
OK.

300
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,100
Let's get everything ready.

301
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,830
Now on the next section what we will do.

302
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,510
It's the you know the interesting part of this.

303
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,930
This is not interesting.

304
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:05,080
But on the next one we will go to the server fetched a list of teams feed them right here then we'll

305
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:11,720
get the idea you know this entry we will populate all the fields you know everything that we need to

306
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,070
do.

1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,030
All right.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,010
So they home which is pretty much finished.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,180
There's nothing else we need to do now the next thing is going to be creating a log in.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,530
If I go to the final project you know this is what is on a different port and I go to for Shlash sign

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,890
n we get you know the place log in and we will be able to enter an e-mail and a password and it will

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,400
go to the database check if we have a user on that database we can enable authentication.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,610
And of course if the user is on the database of the you know our users if it's OK we're going to let

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,210
the user and if not of course.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,540
OK.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,480
If not of course we going to let the user out of course.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:41,980
OK.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,830
So if we go to authentication if we go to firebase and we go to authentication of course we get that

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,660
we get this just like this.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,440
And I'm going to say OK when we get an AD user and whatever version of this is OK and it says to add

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,380
users man it manually enabled password and password e-mail and sign in Methot.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,210
So by default we need to provide firebase to tell firebase what kind of what kind of method to be using

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,930
for signing in users.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:20,600
Because firebase they give you several waste to you know log in a user or log out a user we can use

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,640
email and password by phone.

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,510
You know they have an Gool connector.

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:31,340
You know we can sign end with a Google account with Facebook and you know whatever for now we're going

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,020
to use does want to use e-mail and password so I can get email going to enable.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,610
And for now I'm going to say just this.

24
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,600
All right.

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,170
So if we go to users we can manually add users so I'm going to do that right now I'm going to add Francis

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:56,360
at G-mail that come and are going to add a password very simple password pass word 1 to 3 that's the

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,480
password.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,780
So I'm going to add the user of course they will need a token and everything else will hash the passwords

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,820
and everything else.

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,250
This is the user ID.

31
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,020
So now if you want to connect and check if the user can log in to this you're going to do it from here.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,370
We don't have it so far.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,720
We get it created right now.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,380
So let's go back to our project first.

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,550
And this log in section.

36
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,230
This one is going to be pretty pretty similar with that right here.

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,180
So we can do copy paste of a lot of things on the next section on the next section now and the next

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,680
project begin to use a different way of sign an end of this a big forms and the reset forms and everything

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,300
else we will use it pretty much the same but on a different ways going to be much much nicer.

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,740
All right.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,700
So first what do we need.

42
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,390
We need a route right.

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,610
We need a way to go to four SLAs sign in and get at least the screen.

44
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,810
So OK I'm going to go right here close everything we have home because home is finished and I'm going

45
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,650
to go to components and create of course a place for this.

46
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:10,250
So I'm going to call it sign n now inside assign n I will add an index that is of course sign in it's

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,730
going to be a reac classmates component.

48
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,400
So let me go and I'm going to change it to sign in.

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,660
All right.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,620
Copy paste and say sign in doesn't matter right now.

51
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,000
OK so now of course we need to create a route.

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,690
We need to set the routes so we can listen for this route.

53
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:38,960
So I'm going to go to routes and I'm going to import import just like this and then sign in from that

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,920
forward slash components for Slash and sign in.

55
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,720
And of course I'm going to make a reference to this route so I'm going to copy the one we have right

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,430
now.

57
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to go on top of this home route and of course I'm going to pass this sign in and the route

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,100
is going to be signed underscore in.

59
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,300
All right.

60
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,250
That is that.

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,060
Of course the application reloads.

62
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,220
And if I go to sign and of course we get this but if we inspect this we should be getting that you know

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,970
that sign and text inside of the main div..

64
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,610
So let me let me just try to find it.

65
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:16,900
There we go.

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,110
We get it right here.

67
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,250
And so we are able to render the route.

68
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,130
Now we need to do all the logic for you know showing what we are doing right now.

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,870
You know showing the the contents and the inputs and the everything else.

70
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,550
So just like the end role we have right here we need this state.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,710
So I'm going to copy all of this and get a copy the state overall and leave and roll open because we're

72
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,630
going to do some copying from here.

73
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,260
And I'm going to go to sign in and I'm going to say OK.

74
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,020
So we want to get a state with the form error from success and inside form data we'll have an e-mail

75
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,020
right.

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,230
And for now everything else is the same.

77
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,900
The only thing the only thing right now is that we need a passport input.

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,000
So I'm going to copy this one I'm going to put a coma.

79
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,230
And of course I'm going to add one different one so this one is going to be password right.

80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,800
Makes sense.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,070
Passport and the element is still going to be unemployed.

82
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,570
The name of course is Passport input passport.

83
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,670
The type is going to be of course passport and enter your passport.

84
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,560
Right.

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,900
The validation it's not an e-mail.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,980
And the only thing I'm going to be using right now is going to be required.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,380
And of course we're still getting the ballot and the validation message now just like we did before.

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,190
We need to use the form fields we created on the roll you know.

89
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,820
So again going to grab grab the form fields and I'm going to put it right here at the top.

90
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,250
Now the location it's a little bit different.

91
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,580
We need to do dot dot force last July and then form fills.

92
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,680
Now just like here we are using the validate methods.

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,890
So I'm going to copy validate can it go right here.

94
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,480
Paste it at the bottom.

95
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,960
And again one directory down.

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,710
All right.

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,720
Of course if you reload the application nothing happens.

98
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,400
But we're not getting any errors in saying that we are not using this but you know it's a warning not

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,120
an error.

100
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,860
OK.

101
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,440
So now we need to start creating the lay out where are we going to be putting the input input the name

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,210
the username the e-mail actually and the password.

103
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,050
So I'm going to go to the render.

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,390
And of course going into this and inside I'm going to say class name and it's going to be container

105
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,130
can are there go inside of here.

106
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:50,240
Another div is going to put another div and the class for this one again is going to be sign in wrapper

107
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,850
class name sign an underscore wrapper.

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,360
No camel case.

109
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,650
And I'm going to add some styles to this I can add a margin.

110
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,440
There we go.

111
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,140
Margin and the margin is going to be 100 pixels.

112
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,280
Let me do it right.

113
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,170
There we go.

114
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,190
It's winter in my country so my house right now it's a little bit cold.

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,210
My hands are you know kind of frozen.

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:27,830
So of course we're going to get a form in the form if you remember we will add this on submit equals

117
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,120
and of course we will get a function just to function right.

118
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,640
And we will be passing that event function and we will call a function that calls this submit form.

119
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,630
Just like with the before mid form.

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,460
All right.

121
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,250
And of course who will be passing this event.

122
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,190
We don't have the submit form are going to be created right now.

123
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,860
So it's bad form opening close.

124
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,170
And for now that is inside the form.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,790
Of course we will have a title.

126
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,030
So I have used an h.

127
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,650
So please log in.

128
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,500
All right let's see what we get.

129
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,830
All right so we get to get the log in when we close the console.

130
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,110
So please log in.

131
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,630
So now we need to add the form feels so right.

132
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,610
We kind of know this so I'm going to go to and roll back and go back to the bottom and right here we

133
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,480
have the form fill and it's pretty much the same one.

134
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,190
So going to copy this one and paste it right here on the bottom where you still have the idea of e-mail

135
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,530
the form data is is still the form data and we didn't have this update form so I'm going to go right

136
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,960
here and copy the name and create a function update form.

137
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,170
Right.

138
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,380
Of course we have one more field which is the password.

139
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,600
So copy paste and then password.

140
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,620
All right.

141
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,380
Now right here this that state that form data e-mail no is going to be passport and then changed.

142
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,010
Same thing.

143
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,640
Does that update form with the elements if we check it out.

144
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,950
Enter e-mail and enter password.

145
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,260
So we are get you know once you create one you know for the forms and everything else everything else

146
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,100
you know gets a little bit easier.

147
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,690
That's why it took us a long time to do this and roll.

148
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,230
All right.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,880
So what else.

150
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,830
We need a button.

151
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,720
So are going to go back to enroll and you know copy the same button now instead of in roll.

152
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,390
Of course it's going to be in.

153
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:24,930
Right.

154
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,640
Makes sense.

155
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,650
So log in.

156
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,820
OK.

157
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,120
So far so good.

158
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,780
Now of course we need to fill the submit form and the update form right.

159
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,230
So OK.

160
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,560
So we have it right here.

161
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,120
So I'm going to go to enroll and go to the update form because we need to update the state just like

162
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,940
with it before.

163
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,290
Now what are we going to be using right here is the exact same thing.

164
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,000
So I'm going to copy this function going to go right here and pasted right here.

165
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,880
Now in theory if this works OK.

166
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,780
Whenever we go to here and we type something know we are getting everything and we are even getting

167
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,560
validation.

168
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,640
So again why typing all of this again.

169
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,500
We just need to copy paste.

170
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,820
Like totally for in the future we're going to use this in a different way so we will not be doing copy

171
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,660
pasting.

172
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,370
We're not going to copy paste.

173
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:18,810
All right.

174
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,690
So what is next.

175
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,680
We have the submit form right.

176
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,230
OK.

177
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,710
We go to submit form.

178
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,280
Let me go right here submit form.

179
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,600
We have this so I'm going to copy the whole segment for him for now.

180
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,230
I get to go to here submit form and paste it.

181
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,830
And of course a lot of things we are not going to really use which is to firebase and everything else

182
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,950
stays the same.

183
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,410
The only thing I did I did the I deleted the firebase request and for now that is it right now.

184
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
We're going to right here.

185
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,400
We're going to do.

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,040
We're going to send the request to find ways to check if the user is healthy and decayed and if not.

187
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,810
But first we're going to check.

188
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,970
We get everything we need inside data to submit.

189
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,710
So I'm going to do console log opening close data to submit.

190
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,520
We make this a little bit bigger.

191
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,550
So inspect.

192
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,190
There we go.

193
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,330
So if I go to console and I type whatever and then whatever doesn't matter I'm going to log in and we

194
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,340
get the e-mail and the password.

195
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,120
So all right.

196
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,460
So everything works ok.

197
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,800
Real simple like it's all there once we have this one all the logic for this one.

198
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,210
Everything else is just you know piece of cake.

199
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,990
Ok so now in the next section we're going to go to the next section and we will make this request we'll

200
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,500
make a request to firebase and check if the user needs really authenticated or not.

201
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:48,260
And if the user it's authenticated right if the e-mail and password are true we will send the user to

202
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,770
the admin dashboard that we don't have so far we can create it of course.

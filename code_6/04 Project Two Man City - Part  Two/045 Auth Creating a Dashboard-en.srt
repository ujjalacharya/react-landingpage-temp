1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,530
Right.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,280
So at the end this is how the dashboard should look.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:13,110
We have in the left a bar that it should be only displayed the site admin routes whenever the user goes

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,700
to the dashboard.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,160
You know in and route that it's only for administrators that we can show this the same navigation bar.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,230
So just like the header and footer we will create a high or there component for this one.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,170
And of course right now the dashboard is empty and on the matches or at match.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,310
We can add the logic on that once for now.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,080
This is what we get.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
This is what we have so far.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,340
So let's go to our or obligation or project and start creating this.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,020
I'm going to close and roll and get close index and get close to the fire base that is just going to

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,490
leave routes.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,000
Now all the admin routes I went to store them inside of a directory called admin.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,540
So I'm going to go to component's create a new directory sorry new directory and this one will be called

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,160
admin.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,590
Right.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,670
Kind of a make sense.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,200
You call this whatever you want.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,310
Doesn't matter.

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:10,080
Now the first component inside admin will be dashboard because is the component where you go after you

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,510
log in.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,460
Of course.

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,780
So I'm going to call it dashboard with a capital D dash board.

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,390
Yes.

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,270
Now dashboard dodgiest will be our re-act stateless component because the only thing we are doing right

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,490
here is just showing the layout and kind of redirect.

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,010
So that's the diff.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:39,760
The main div will be called class name and add a class name of user dashboard user or underscore dashboard.

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:49,380
And inside here just the device going to do something very simple saying this is your dashboard whenever

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,910
it doesn't matter.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,630
Just something very simple.

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,310
OK.

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,070
So of course if I reload the application nothing really happens because we need to add everything to

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,750
routes.

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,820
So I'm going to make a space in all the other routes are going to be right here.

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,580
Right.

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:16,020
So I'm going to import then dashboard from DOT for Slash components for Slash at men forward slash dashboard.

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,950
Right.

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,930
And I'm going to copy dashboard.

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,450
I'm going to copy this one right here to duplicate us and I'm going to say route.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,570
It's dashboard whenever we want to go to.

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,140
You guessed it dashboard just like this.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,020
All right.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,670
So if I reload it you know we get this dashboard.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,100
So now we need to create this now.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,460
And this is going to be high or other component.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,340
So I'm going to go back to dashboard and right now of course we don't have this we need to create it.

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,320
So inside a Choe see we're going to create a new file called admin and then layout just like this.

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,270
I've been laid down yes.

51
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,840
So the only purpose of admin lay down dodgiest is going to be returning the container of this coat you

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,650
know the admin routes.

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,710
So it is going to be a reacts the Blitz component just like this and it will be called I've been lay

54
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,320
out that has get in some some part of the application will be receiving some prompts.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,660
I'm just going to put props right here.

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:24,510
Now the the wrapper for this are going to add a class name that calls up men underscore container.

57
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,850
And now we will have two two main parts.

58
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,010
The one in the left which is the now and then all the contents in the right.

59
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,220
So I need to create two deps one for the nav and another one for the of course the right side of the

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,740
screen.

61
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,370
So the main one which is the nav section are going to call it admin.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,570
Underscore left now.

63
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,700
Now right here of course we're going to put the now navigation.

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,830
Now of course the other one will be class name mean underscore.

65
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,020
Right and right here we need to to enter to put whatever content we get from here.

66
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,180
You know the children.

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,050
So that's why we get props.

68
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:18,830
So I'm going to say props that children of course if I recall the application we get nothing because

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,380
we are we do we do have this and been lay out but we're not really using it on the dashboard.

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:24,980
OK.

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,870
So I'm going to go right here at the top and we need to import this to the actual dashboard.

72
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,250
Right.

73
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,140
Makes sense.

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:42,630
So of course import import or go import men then lay out then from and make it right.

75
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,190
I've been lay out from that that for Slashdot that for Slash a chose C for Slash and layout.

76
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,810
So every time when we have a we have an amazing route.

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,900
We need to wrap it.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,170
We need to wrap the components inside.

79
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,960
I mean lay out components.

80
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,410
And of course all of this will create what we are actually doing right now with a choke seat.

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,060
So if I reload the application you know we get this block.

82
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,180
Now of course we need to create this right now and everything in the ride is going to be the actual

83
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,320
content of the components.

84
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,950
Now we need to create that now and then going to store it not on HBO series are going to start an admin

85
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,330
because that NAV that navigation bar belongs to admin routes.

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,480
So I'm going to say now now inside of the app of course we need the admin now.

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,250
So I'm going to create a file called admin.

88
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,160
Now could be could be next.

89
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,040
If you want.

90
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,590
OK so I am now going to do several things.

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,260
We don't need a class based component.

92
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,460
So I'm going to say re-act stateless components.

93
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,950
Been very good.

94
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,120
Now we're going to be using LINQ because they are just links.

95
00:05:52,280 --> 00:06:00,090
So import opening close link from re-act router.

96
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,520
Dom very good.

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,770
That's the first thing we're going to be using a maybe list items we're going to do later.

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,460
Maybe firebase But again we're going to do it later.

99
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,620
So for now the only thing we need to do we need to just render some items.

100
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:23,150
Ok so I'm going to go right here and I'm going to create a function called render and then items just

101
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,260
like this just turned right it's just a function and I get to go right here at the top.

102
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,930
And of course create dysfunction called render items.

103
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,430
So Konst render items.

104
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:41,430
Now since we're going to get several links in this case we have matches at match players or players.

105
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,720
And then logout we need a place where we're going to be rendering all the sites.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,640
So I want to put them on a list right.

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,180
And they begin to loop them with render items and begin to show the actual item.

108
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,540
Right.

109
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,820
Makes sense.

110
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,710
So first we need to a place where we going to be hosting this links.

111
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:05,510
So I got to say Konst that links cole just an array of objects and right here we're going to be registering

112
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:11,540
the links so they have a title and they have a link to you know where are we going to go after we click

113
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,370
on this one.

114
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,250
So this one is going to be matches which is the first one.

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,030
And then of course the route where we going to be going so I'm going to call it outman matches.

116
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:28,000
All right going into coma you're going to copy this one do one more.

117
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,130
This one is going to be at match and I know that this is boring right now at match and I'm going to

118
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,650
host this one inside.

119
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:42,360
I've been matches and added match just like this could be added or outmatch or something like that doesn't

120
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,870
matter.

121
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,540
We're going to go back to this round later.

122
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,970
Don't worry I'm going to copy this one.

123
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm going to go right here.

124
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,430
And then we can have an end point.

125
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,960
An important to administer players.

126
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,170
So I'm going to call it players and just like I've been matches this one will be I mean players.

127
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,670
Right.

128
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,100
Of main players.

129
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,840
And just like this one we will need to create an end point to admin the players to our players.

130
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,620
So this one I'm going to call it I don't know at players doesn't matter right now.

131
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,610
OK.

132
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:23,300
So what do we need to do now is to render all this content all this links in the in a linked form.

133
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,630
Right.

134
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,820
Because right now we have an object.

135
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,320
So you're going to say links that map over the course now every each iteration we will be receiving

136
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,150
a link.

137
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,810
And of course then we will run an up function.

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,650
Now if you noticed I'm using and this is actually my mistake.

139
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,180
I'm I went to render.

140
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,470
I went to return some GSX but I'm using not princesses.

141
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,600
Nothing is going to work.

142
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,320
All right.

143
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,360
So on each iteration we get a link and what we will do we will return a link from Briac granddaughter

144
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,530
of course open and close.

145
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,990
I know what I'm not getting the complete for link.

146
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,160
I don't know why.

147
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,040
And.

148
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:10,750
So of course with each link we have two and we two we need to pass the where we're going to go.

149
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,580
So we have an inside link just like this dot link to.

150
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,020
Of course we are looping something.

151
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,540
We need to add a key so key opening close link dot and are going to use the title as a key.

152
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,870
You can pass the torsion number and pass the Teuscher number.

153
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,890
Now just a little before if we check the or find one we get to use the material.

154
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,860
I list items.

155
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:47,510
So I'm going to go right here at the top an important list item for material you eyes so import list

156
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,400
I mean make it ride list item.

157
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,330
All right.

158
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:01,850
From opening close at material the ice core for Slash and the name of whatever we are importing from

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,950
the court.

160
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,920
All right.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,970
So now I'm going to copy this name list item I'm going to go inside the link.

162
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,910
And of course we need to pass this link items up link list item sorry.

163
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,450
So open close.

164
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:22,590
Now instead of the last item we need to put the name of the link which is inside link that title.

165
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,980
And of course we need to specify what kind of item we want from material.

166
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,470
In this case we want a button and it can add Bassam stylings are going to modify the default stylings.

167
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,070
So going to create a viable when are going to be hosting this style.

168
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,460
So Kansas style and this is actually very common.

169
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,990
So color is going to be white which is three four five six.

170
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,010
Then I want to make it make the phones a little bit bigger.

171
00:10:50,090 --> 00:11:00,830
So Fonte that wait and I'm going to use oh sorry Lider 300 then I'm going to add a border bottom so

172
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:08,770
border and then Boneham are not getting more their bottom.

173
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,240
All right.

174
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,610
And we'll add one pixel solid solid color.

175
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,810
It's 3 5 3 5 3 5.

176
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,150
And of course I will just pass these tiles to this.

177
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,350
So Style style style.

178
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,270
Right.

179
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:26,760
All right.

180
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,230
Let's see what we get.

181
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,320
So the application should be reloading and we are not getting anything because I forgot to do something.

182
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,490
Maybe you got it right.

183
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:44,170
So I've created the nav component but I'm not including this inside the H O C right.

184
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,160
So I'm going to do import just like this.

185
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,130
And I believe we call this at bin now.

186
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:58,810
So I've been Napp from that that forward slash and components and abdomen and then Nav. and then admen

187
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,820
now.

188
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,770
Now of course make reference to this really simple at this point.

189
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,830
This should be really easy for you.

190
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,450
So we get matches we get match players and players I made a mistake and that's why I'm going to change

191
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,140
you right now.

192
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,860
So if I go to Majerus we go to the matches at at least the link works.

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,120
So let me fix this.

194
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,860
I've added players.

195
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,440
So what we want to do we want to add players

196
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,900
that is get now in theory we are locked in.

197
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:38,040
Right we are locked in because we did the log in and we got the information so we get some some some

198
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,110
logic inside the application right here.

199
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:51,340
Let me just show you inspect inside the application begin to get the storage the local stores.

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,630
Maybe the session source.

201
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,110
There we go.

202
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,730
So we get this.

203
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,110
So in theory we are kind of authenticated.

204
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,070
So we need to log out button right here.

205
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:10,390
And for this one of course we need to use firebase and it's the signing out method a fire base is just

206
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,450
like the other indication it's really really simple.

207
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,310
So what I'm going to do I going to add just right here and I'm going to add it manually list item I

208
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,910
could do it you know from a different place but I want to add an unclick handler.

209
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,460
That's why I'm adding this manually.

210
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,730
So let me do open close and this one is going to be log out.

211
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,790
So but then of course the style is going to be the same style we are using at the top.

212
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,200
We are almost done with this.

213
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,490
I know that this is simple and a little bit boring but we are almost done that unclick equals two and

214
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm going to create a function which is going to be the log out log out and then handler just like this

215
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,160
handler.

216
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,980
All right.

217
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,640
And now this function of course is going to do all the locking out when have this function get created

218
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,540
right now.

219
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,340
Konst logout handler.

220
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,370
And this one is going to be equal to a function.

221
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,540
And of course we can do something.

222
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,880
So what are we going to do.

223
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,940
It's real simple just going to show you first we need to include firebase at the top.

224
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:30,250
So import than firebase firebase then from that for Slash that dot for Slash and dot dot for Slash and

225
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,020
firebase.

226
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,850
Right.

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,670
So just like we did with the owls.

228
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,890
This is the same thing.

229
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,610
I need to use firebase and use our opening close and I'm going to use sign out this is the method they

230
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,000
provide us to sign out users.

231
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,360
And then of course after they are signed out you get you get a promise.

232
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,060
So whenever you get the promise back you just do whatever you want.

233
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,490
In this case I'm going to do a log and then log out.

234
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,280
So successful just something like that.

235
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,220
Really simple right.

236
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,860
That is it.

237
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,910
And this is the first the first one.

238
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,680
All right.

239
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,350
Now of course on the second right here what we could do we could add a different function.

240
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,440
And of course this one is going to be error.

241
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,150
So if we do have an error we're going to do a console log and error logging out

242
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,090
so this way this way of doing things.

243
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,510
It's just like the documentation for all this this this is the actual the condition just like this.

244
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,440
So if you go there you can find the same example.

245
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,960
So right here where you could do you could push the user back home or you know whatever you want.

246
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,600
Right now I'm just I'm just going to add a con..

247
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,490
So OK so we get export default imported firebase now found in firebase.

248
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,760
Let me see why.

249
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,880
What did I do.

250
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,470
I know I'm important in putting a default and it's not a default.

251
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,240
All right.

252
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:05,690
So dashboard if I go to inspect log out log out successful.

253
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,320
If I do it again you know it's just going to log out.

254
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,830
But nothing really happens.

255
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,620
OK.

256
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,580
So everything good so now we have a problem if the users log in.

257
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,140
I just lock down the user.

258
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,920
And if I reload the application we're still able to enter dashboard so you know this is a big big mistake.

259
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,670
So what do we need to do.

260
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:33,970
We need to go to routes and prevent users create some function or create some logic to prevent users

261
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:41,690
by going going from a to dashboard or sign in if the are authenticated or not and dictated so we can

262
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,620
create a function to prevent routes.

263
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,280
Right.

264
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:45,670
OK.

265
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,120
So let's go to the next one and do this.

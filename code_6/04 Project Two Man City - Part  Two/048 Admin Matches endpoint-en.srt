1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,470
Good so now we're going to create this is going to be the end point of mattress so we can you know check

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,870
the matches we have on the database.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:15,210
If I go to the database and a little it's slow but it's OK if I go to the database.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,660
Inside the data we are going to get matches.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:26,100
So all the matches we have of course special properties away the thumbnail of the team that plays away

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,000
the date if it's final the local And you know everything else we're going to check this right now.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:32,710
OK.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,700
So first of course we don't have a component to render the mattress so we need to create it.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,090
So are going to go to admen going to close the app are going to create a new directory inside admen

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,800
called matches.

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,740
Of course since this is an admin route I'm going to put everything inside admin and inside matches is

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,990
going to be the index of mattress Burguet.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:03,020
Now of course this will be a class based component so re-act classmate component and it calls me admin

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,940
and then matches you can call this again whatever you want.

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,510
Since this is anatman route I will put admin at the front of it.

16
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,180
OK.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,380
So we need a few things.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:23,300
I'm going to import I'm going to import link just like this link from of course re-act rotor Dom from

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,300
re-act router Dohm.

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,470
Very good.

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,740
What else we were going to use that and mend layout.

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,150
We've been using you know the bar right here so we need to import it aswell.

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:44,270
Import admin and then lay out from that that force last deadly that force lashed out that force lash

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,110
and then of course it's going to be a for Slash at mean layout and a good copy the only out and put

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,130
it right here.

26
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,980
All right that is get so inside of this.

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,600
For now I'm going to say table instead of this we will create a table.

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,670
So this is the final one and this table comes from material.

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,980
I say it's real simple to do but we need to import a lot of things.

30
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,990
So my recommendation right now is for you to go to material you.

31
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,080
I go to component's demos and this is what I'm going to do.

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,990
Go to component demos and search for tables that would do it right now.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,780
When whenever you go to tables of course you can get a lot of examples.

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,960
So we're going to use this one.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,780
The first one.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,920
If I open this they will give you the code of you know whatever is that you want to do.

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,300
And right here you can and you can get all the inputs.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,190
So we need to type all of this so instead of typing.

39
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,080
I'm just going to copy from here.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,410
He's going to copy.

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,320
Go right here to the top and I'm going to paste that you know.

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,760
Typing all of this.

43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,440
Bar.

44
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,440
So we are going to use Table Table body cell held head row and paper and then we can to use something

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,660
else.

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,100
But going to do it later.

47
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,370
So OK so before we do anything we need to link this route.

48
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:09,590
This match's route two routes so lets go two routes and we need of course to import at Bin matches so

49
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,510
I'm going to go right here.

50
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:21,760
Import at men matches from DOT for Slash components that for Slash at men again matches.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,450
And since this is the US there's no need to put index.

52
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,770
So now we need to create the route.

53
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,880
So I'm going to copy the previous route which is the private route.

54
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,930
This is a private route and I'm going to paste it down up here of course is that the component it's

55
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,050
going to be at mismatches and the location it's at Main underscore matches.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,700
All right so if we go to our components I go to Dasch more.

57
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,520
I go to mattress and we get that table so everything works ok.

58
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,540
Of course now we're going to fix this now before we do anything in order to render the mattress.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,340
We need to bring them from the database from mattress.

60
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:06,210
So again we need to bring the firebase database right here.

61
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:15,030
OK so I'm going to go back to matches and are going to open the firebase thing.

62
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,100
Now we do have a firebase matches so what we can do.

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,290
We can't just import it right here at the top.

64
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,940
There's no need to create a new a new of Barville for this.

65
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,590
So it's called firebase mattress participate firebase matches.

66
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,220
All right.

67
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:40,160
And it's from Dot dot dot dot for Slashdot for Slash and then firebase.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,360
Now maybe you remember what we did at home that we were using that function we have an misc called firebase

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,700
Luper to get the data in the way we want and then we reversed the array.

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,820
Well we're going to do the same thing right here.

71
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:00,920
So I'm going to import import opening close firebase.

72
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,140
Luper.

73
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,330
I love that word.

74
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,950
Luper.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,830
I don't know why.

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,640
Maybe because of the movie and the reverse array.

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,810
Very good movie.

78
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:20,620
So from there of course that for Slashdot for Slash you I for Slash and then misc OK so pretty much

79
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,110
everything everything we need.

80
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,160
Of course whenever they could they can put in loads on the component amount.

81
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,270
After remounts of course we need to make a request to bring the list of matches.

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,920
Now I'm going to store everything inside the state after we get the data and I get it create two different

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:47,110
places is loading something like this which is going to be true and then matches are right and matches

84
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,410
is going to be just an empty an empty right now.

85
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,590
Of course since we can go to the database until we get the matches it might take some time maybe a seconds

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,110
maybe milliseconds depending on firebase.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,280
So what are we going to do.

88
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,800
We're going to check right here.

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,520
If everything it's loading it's loading the matches and we will just call this play a progress bar.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,330
And of course after we get the matches we're going to clear the state of it's loading to falls and we

91
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,620
will remove that progress bar.

92
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:26,670
So if we go to materials I and we go to progress we can get something like this so we can use this in

93
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,070
our website.

94
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,400
So let me open this.

95
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,740
So what we need to import.

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,940
It's circular progress from matyr core and everything else.

97
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,740
So I mean to copy and paste it down here.

98
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,570
All right.

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,460
So now I'm going to go at the bottom and I get to say OK I'm going to create a div and add a class name

100
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,720
just like this.

101
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,920
Of admin progress.

102
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,400
Write correctly.

103
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,440
Progress.

104
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:05,680
OK so instead of the progress we need to check if we are still loading if the state is slowing so does

105
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,770
not state that is loading.

106
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,540
If we are loading which is true we can display that progress.

107
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,550
If not you're not going to do anything.

108
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,800
Just an empty empty string could be Nouel doesn't matter.

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,990
OK so I'm going to copy that circular our progress and put it here.

110
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,910
Now we have some props we can be.

111
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,730
We can pass to this component.

112
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,450
Either way if I go right here we get something at least.

113
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,080
But we can pass some Starling's we can modify that a little bit more.

114
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,150
So I want to change the thickness so thick ness just like this.

115
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,520
And for this one we can pass a value from zero from 1 to 10.

116
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,930
I'm going to use 7 which is pretty thick.

117
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,380
Ok then we can stay a style the color.

118
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,420
So I'm going to say style equals opening close and say color.

119
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,620
Then make it right.

120
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,020
Color equals to that light blue.

121
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,210
We have on the website so 9 8 see 5 9.

122
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,570
It's the same blue we have on the top.

123
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,570
Light blue and there we go a little bit nicer.

124
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,030
All right.

125
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,880
So now let's fetch the things from the server.

126
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,070
Did the teams so just like with it before.

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,230
We're going to go to the component did mount opening close and after everything mounts we get a call

128
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,220
that firebase firebase matches just like this.

129
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:39,580
We're going to bring the ones and we're going to bring the value of course this will return a promise.

130
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,420
So we will grab that then.

131
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,230
And just like with it before it will return something.

132
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:54,040
And what's it going to be returning is the snapshot now again once we get the snapshot the information

133
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,360
we need is going to be inside a snapshot that BOL and we need to use the firebase Luper to get the data

134
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,670
inside of a normal array.

135
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,000
So going to create a variable called matches just like this and this one is going to be equal to firebase

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,560
Luper and I'm going to bring this snapshot and convert this.

137
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
All right.

138
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,210
So after we do this we have the match's information in the way we want.

139
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,230
So what we do we do this that set stayed open and close and we're going to change this state of loading

140
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:35,130
two files so we can remove that progress and begin to say that now matches equals two matches.

141
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,400
But the thing is that we need to change the order we need to use that reverse array just like with it

142
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,920
before at home.

143
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,230
So reverse array equals to this.

144
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,040
No matches equals to reverse array.

145
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,540
And then matches.

146
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,690
OK so now I'm going to go to the render and do console log just to make sure that we are getting all

147
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,870
the data we need.

148
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:04,870
There's that state BRIGADA going to reload the application and after a while we get the we get the you

149
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,570
know we remove the the progress bar.

150
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,830
We check the state.

151
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,810
We do have all the matches.

152
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,870
So you know it works.

153
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,380
So now what we need to do we need to add to table this table.

154
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,050
All right it's going to be simple but now that's simple because we need to type a lot lot of things.

155
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:29,880
So I'm going to go right here after the first I've been lay out I'm going to remove the console log.

156
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,980
This we don't really eat it.

157
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,490
And inside the layout will just pretty much wrap everything in a dish.

158
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,040
So I'm going to say Divx open and close and I'm going to put the diff at the ends.

159
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,440
All right.

160
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:49,480
Now inside the first div we need to create the table so I'm going to start with paper and this of course

161
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,720
everything is on the documentation of material you I first are going to wrap everything in paper right.

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,330
Not real paper.

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,040
Then we do a table opening close.

164
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,920
Right.

165
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,180
So what do we need first.

166
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,950
We need the table hetter you know the table head just like a normal table.

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,220
So table head opening close and then I'm going to put all the head and the heads inside.

168
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,800
Now inside the table head we need to create a table row.

169
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,380
All right.

170
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,110
Open the table road and we will put all everything inside.

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:31,960
So what we need to add is going to be the date that match the resoled and then the final are still getting

172
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,470
something.

173
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,060
All right.

174
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,830
So for each we need to add a table cell just like this.

175
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,700
Open and close the first one is going to be the date.

176
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,830
Then me make it right.

177
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,530
Date.

178
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,640
We need a table.

179
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,000
We need to match.

180
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,870
We need the results.

181
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,160
And then the final.

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,700
OK.

183
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:56,780
So it's match then resold and then final.

184
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,630
All right.

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,120
So OK so if I have the obligation.

186
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,500
That's nice.

187
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:02,990
OK.

188
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,840
So now what are going to be doing is pretty much adding the content.

189
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,350
You know the table body.

190
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,360
We have table we have table head.

191
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,940
So after table had it's table body body.

192
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,130
There you go.

193
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,480
So now inside of the body pretty much we need to add a row but each row is going to be the match they're

194
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,760
going to be the matches.

195
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,250
So for each row we add a match.

196
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,430
And for this we need to loop this that state that matches remember.

197
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,230
All right.

198
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,920
So I'm going to close this so I can make some space and I am going to start writing some logic.

199
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:50,330
So we just need to loop something so this that state that matches if we do have matches then we're going

200
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,220
to move forward.

201
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,930
If not are going to remove I'm going to return.

202
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,330
No all right.

203
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,900
OK.

204
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,090
So instead of here if we do have matches what do we do we loop something.

205
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,610
So I'm going to loop this.

206
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,770
That state that matches just like this.

207
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,570
That map opening close and we will be using two different things.

208
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,540
Which is the match and the each situation.

209
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,930
And of course we will return some GSX at this.

210
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,880
All right.

211
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Again we need to return a table row.

212
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,590
Open and close and do it correctly.

213
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,300
Table row and inside of course the table Rosens we are looping something we need to pass a key.

214
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,120
So it's going to be key off and the iteration number in this case.

215
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:46,740
Now on each part on each cell we need to pass a table cell and just going to copy this one and I'm going

216
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,810
to say table cell.

217
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,340
So the first one is the date.

218
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:56,080
So we're going to mix a space and say match that date.

219
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,800
And this of course comes from the server.

220
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,070
You know we get to date.

221
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,550
So that is cool.

222
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,680
What else what else do we need to do.

223
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,030
We need to add a new table cell.

224
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,500
This one for the in the match you know the match.

225
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,670
And this one is going to be a little bit different.

226
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:21,050
Now the thing is that what I want to do whenever you find one if I click and this match is going to

227
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,290
take us to match and the ID of the match.

228
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,210
All right.

229
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,770
So so of course this is the edit section of the of the match.

230
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,810
We don't have that yet.

231
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,020
We're going to create it later but for now we're going to leave it ready.

232
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,960
So first I want to create a link.

233
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,670
Again it's not doing the out to complete the task.

234
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,310
I don't know why.

235
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:51,420
So the link of course we need to pass the two so to opening close and we'll be using template strings.

236
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,880
So we need to CO-2 at men then matches.

237
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,570
We didn't have this right.

238
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:02,450
So the edit underscore match and then forced laugh or last four slash.

239
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,380
And the idea of the match which is match that ID.

240
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,470
Of course we didn't have this component or route we're going to create this much later.

241
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,100
And of course we need to add the team that plays away.

242
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:25,520
So match way everything is on the Jason and I going to add a strong just like this strong and a dash

243
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,480
in the mill.

244
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,090
And then of course we need to pass the match that local.

245
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,000
And if we check it go get it.

246
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,680
And of course if I click on this we go to matches at that match and the ID of the match.

247
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,090
All right.

248
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,290
So everything so far so good.

249
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,350
So next next it's going to be the result.

250
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,680
So this one looks just like this one.

251
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,070
We don't have a link on this one.

252
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,670
So it just will create a table cell table cell and make some space.

253
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:02,090
So on this one we will output to match dot resoled and then away.

254
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:11,510
And again we will do this strong line just like this and we'll say match dot and the result and then

255
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,730
of course local.

256
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,650
All right.

257
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,270
That is get and if you were the application were simple.

258
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,080
Didn't put much thought on this one.

259
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,640
This is one.

260
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,350
This is just something very very simple.

261
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,130
We're going to spend a lot of time doing the edit match and the match.

262
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,610
Of course that's I believe that it's what you care the most of the section.

263
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,040
All right.

264
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,020
So what else instead of matches.

265
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,370
I go instead of after and the result which is this when we get the final.

266
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:52,670
Now on the final show you the original one and find one you get the red with the final.

267
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,220
If the game was already played and the game that was not played of course we get a green and nothing

268
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,960
on the result.

269
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,460
So we are still getting anything.

270
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,540
Nothing on there were sold.

271
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,470
That is good.

272
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,560
So now I'm going to go and create a table cell.

273
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,880
And this is the last one.

274
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,830
The last thing we're going to do and this component going to makes in space and I need to check if the

275
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,760
match final is equal to something if you check the database we don't have a boolean.

276
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,720
We have a yes or we have a no.

277
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,810
So I'm going to check.

278
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:30,420
Match final match dot dot final it's equal triple equal because we are matching everything.

279
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,020
Yes and if it's equal to yes we're going to do something or do something else.

280
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:42,750
So right here we will return as Pan non-test Pam as Pan.

281
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:51,230
There we go with the class name off matches then tack then red.

282
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,770
This is the red one and this one should be same final.

283
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,880
And then the other one it's pretty much the same thing.

284
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,970
But of course with a different closet a different text.

285
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:07,560
So which has returned his pen which match tock and then green and not played yet

286
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,280
yet there we go.

287
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,370
All right let's see how it goes.

288
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,480
So get you know looks nice really simple but looks nice.

289
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Now the important thing about this is that now we can click on it and click on something and go to Edit

290
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,510
match.

291
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,080
And this is what we're going to be doing on the next section.

292
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,770
Right.

293
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,510
So everything it's done in this one is going to give you the code just for the you know the code of

294
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:41,540
the our application to this point because an edit match we can spend a lot of time.

295
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,960
All right.

296
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,910
So let's go to the next section.

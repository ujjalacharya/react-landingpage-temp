1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,610
OK so before we start preventing routes we need one more route.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,730
We need to pre-event which is you know the use or dash for it.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,550
If I go two routes we have the register and the log in which are not really private routes because they

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,120
are public.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,100
If you're not logged in and then of course we have a public.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,810
So now we need to create one completely private route and that could be the user dashboard.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,330
All right.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,790
So inside of the components what I'm going to do I'm going to create a folder or a directory where we

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,740
are going to be hosting all the private routes.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,620
You know the user private routes are going to create a directory called user and he's out of here.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,700
And this yes this is going to be the user dashboard.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,440
Now the user dashboard is going to be up just of reacts like this component.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:01:00,330
We don't need a class based component and I we call this user dashboard copy paste or I get to say dashboard

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,530
right now and I'm going to add the routes right here.

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:09,640
So import user dashboard from that for Slash components.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,760
Now we have user.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,950
And now of course we don't need to bring it.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,400
So I'm going to copy this and I'm going to paste it down here.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,900
And we're going to be using the user dashboard route right components of the route will be different.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,460
So user forward slash dashboard.

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,090
All right.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,530
So if you go to use a dashboard now we get dashboard that is now on the final one this is what we get

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,420
at the end.

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,590
So the user dashboard should be looking like this.

25
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,120
Now if you notice we have right here the contents and in the left have the nav ride and the nav it's

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,340
always the same.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,450
So it kind of makes sense for us to create a high order component to show the nav and then of course

28
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,970
we will need to change it to show the admin routes which is on the same high or that component.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,190
But we're going to do the admin part of things much later.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,050
Now we're going to create the the high or the components so we can show the children's and the now.

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,950
All right.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,660
So I'm going to go to h o CS and create a new file and I'm going to go.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,910
This user could be called user lay out or something like that.

34
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,820
So this user will show pretty much the nav and the children.

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,930
So this is going to be a re-act stateless component.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,670
We don't need a class right now.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,190
So instead of user going to call it user and then lay out copy paste Raggatt.

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,420
So again we will have links.

39
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:52,630
So I need to import link from re-act router Dom.

40
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,230
All right.

41
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,560
So OK.

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,930
Now first we need a lynx and we need some links and we're going to create a marble where are we going

43
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,570
to be hosting this links.

44
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,680
It's going to create an array of objects with the links inside.

45
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,460
Now each link will have a name and a link to ride.

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,740
Need to pass where are we going to go when we click here.

47
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,240
So in this case the first link is going to be my account that a coma and we need to tell where are we

48
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,900
going to go.

49
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,800
So we're going to go to user and the main one which is dashboard right that I get a copy this.

50
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,340
So we don't need to type over again.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,050
And this one will be the user information.

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,110
Now on user information is going to be pretty much a form where we can update the user profile.

53
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:49,410
So again user profile and we will be able to change the name and you know some user data as we move

54
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,910
forward through the project of course this is going to get much bigger.

55
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,170
So of course whenever the user add something to the cart they need to of course inspect what's inside

56
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,970
the card and make the purchase.

57
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:10,730
So my cart capital-T and this one will be inside user and then card of course we don't have all these

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,050
routes who will create this much later much much later.

59
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,100
So we're going to be displaying children.

60
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,190
I want to get the props from the you know the components.

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,360
Now I'm going to go right here inside and say that I want a class of container.

62
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:34,340
And inside I will create a new div with a class name of user Container container.

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,910
All right now in the left will have the user now in in the right you have the it will get the props

64
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:49,970
that children so div class name of user left now.

65
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,240
Now there we go.

66
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,260
And there right.

67
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:02,780
We will get the class name of user and then right now if I do inside you are right.

68
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,140
Right.

69
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,760
Yeah.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,300
Right.

71
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,100
And then props the children we can get whatever content we get from the parent component.

72
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,440
In this case right now we do we only have dashboard so we can get this keyboard just dashboard in the

73
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,260
left.

74
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:25,920
Of course I need to add a title so I will add an edge to saying my account and after my account I'm

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,190
going to wrap all the links inside of a container called lynx.

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,880
As a matter right now what I'm going to do instead of rendering press here I'm going to create a function

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,930
that calls generate links and I will pass the links we have inside the firewall.

78
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,770
All right.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,170
Pretty simple you know.

80
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,450
Not not so hard.

81
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,090
Really simple stuff.

82
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,770
OK.

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:56,190
So I'm going to create a viable call Konst and then generate links and this link this function will

84
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,410
be receiving the prob of links.

85
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,640
You know the argument links and then we will do something now.

86
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,410
I want to return single sex.

87
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,880
So I need to return this the prentices.

88
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,720
Now we're going to grab this links.

89
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,920
You're going to say map opening close.

90
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,920
Sometimes when I say something and then a pause for two seconds it's to give you time to you know just

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,980
write this.

92
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,900
Of course like it's all the four at the bottom of the BDO you have the go slower option or go faster

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,060
if you want to go faster.

94
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,360
Now on each iteration will you will be oh my god the hour to complete.

95
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,940
Sometimes drives me crazy.

96
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,270
I don't know why it's doing that.

97
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,860
So I put in place besides data transfer item.

98
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,920
What is that.

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,610
So item and then we get I need to go to my plug in inside B-S code and disable all of them.

100
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,230
So whenever we run this function we want to return and Jane sex.

101
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:04,830
So we will do parenthesis instead of brackets and each time on each loop we want to return a link right.

102
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,420
OK.

103
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:13,740
So like now each link will have a name and the name is going to be item that name which is the one we

104
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,280
have right here at the top and the then we need to pass it to.

105
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,660
And that too is going to be item that link to.

106
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,830
And then of course we need to add a key because we're looping something and we will pass that iteration.

107
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,520
This is pretty much done.

108
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,620
So now every time we want to render a private route we need to display the user layout.

109
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:43,820
So I'm going to go right here to index which is the user dashboard and we need to import user layout

110
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:50,890
from that that force last one more time a Tosi for Slash and the user.

111
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,040
All right.

112
00:07:53,050 --> 00:08:00,670
Now what we want to do is we want to wrap the complete rout inside of the user layout.

113
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,740
So now every time we just play around with it with an app in route we need to wrap it with the user

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,430
layout and at the end we get this right.

115
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,950
We get the NAB and then whatever content we have inside.

116
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,480
Now on the dashboard and going to do it right now and the next section we're going to prevent the routes

117
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,240
and then arrange all the links right here at the top so we can have something a little bit more complete

118
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,540
inside of here.

119
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,860
We will have two different sections.

120
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,480
Let me just show you the user information where we can go and edit info and then history of protasis

121
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:38,930
if we do have a history and all that is going to come from the database and we going do it much later.

122
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:48,410
But for now I'm just going to create the minimum layout so user info underscore and then panel any sort

123
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,160
of peer who will get the one with the title which has user information.

124
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:03,040
I'm putting this here because I need to put it someplace and just create a single route for history

125
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,600
a single route for using information and everything else to have makes no sense we're going to do it

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,800
right here now instead of here we'll get a div and expense and span it's going to be the information

127
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,660
above the user.

128
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,660
In this case we were going to put the name the last name and maybe the e-mail.

129
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,030
So again you can choose whatever you want to put right here.

130
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,400
Now of course we need to fetch using information but for that we have the outof route.

131
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,780
So we going to do it in a couple of minutes.

132
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,220
So after here we need a button so we can send the user to edit the account info.

133
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:49,510
So since we are using a button we're going to import my button at the top and we will use reusable components.

134
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,280
So you tell us for a slash and then button.

135
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,420
All right.

136
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:01,210
So if you remember with the button we need to make a reference to it and pass some props.

137
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,120
We have the type which is default we're not going to do anything you write here.

138
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:15,550
So the default then title equals and we no added account info.

139
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,420
All right.

140
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,860
What else.

141
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,620
Since the default link is the default button it's a link.

142
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,640
So we have to look at the property link too.

143
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,880
And this one is going to go to user for Slash.

144
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:39,100
And if you remember we can did this and it's user profile right user profile now but it's got user user

145
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,270
profile could be user information or something like that.

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,230
But this one's OK.

147
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,950
So if I go to user information we just use a profile we kind of get it.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,480
All right.

149
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,070
OK.

150
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,300
So this is get now at the bottom.

151
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,930
We will have the history of protasis are going to create the place where we're going to be putting this.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,900
But begin to do this much later because we need to have.

153
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,790
We need to get on the database at least you know maybe history or something.

154
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,170
Right now we don't have the ability to do that.

155
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,090
So when we get to that section we're going to fill this.

156
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:23,040
So on this one I'm going to put in each one of history so we are almost done.

157
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,580
Car chases one of our purchases.

158
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,240
All right.

159
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,030
And instead of here and this is actually a pretty important class for this one because this is kind

160
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,500
of a table.

161
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,580
So I'm going to put the class right here.

162
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:47,300
And then it will be put the history so class name equals two and I use user underscore product user

163
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:55,500
block and then wrapper and then of course we got the history and we are done.

164
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm going to reload the application right here preloaded and look at it.

165
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,810
But of course we need to do a lot of things.

166
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,560
We will create history later.

167
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,110
But all of this it's pretty much done.

168
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,470
All right.

169
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,910
Go to my information user profile.

170
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,750
My cart my cart everything works.

171
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,810
So now we have a private route a completely private route not so private.

172
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,830
And then we have the plug the public one.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,610
So let's go to the next section and start creating the logic of authenticated user of indicating users.

174
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,180
And then actually creating private and public routes.

175
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,900
And if you remember on the previous the previous project we did we created our own component that managers

176
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,330
of this logic right here.

177
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,950
But right now we are not going to do that.

178
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,880
We're going to do that pretty much the same same exact thing but on a different way.

179
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,950
So let's go to the next one and start with this.

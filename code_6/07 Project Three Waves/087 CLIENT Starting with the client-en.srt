1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,640
OK so now we need to bring the clients you know react to the client.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,740
Right we're going to start with client so.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,160
OK.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,590
So we need to do create we act out.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,770
Very simple.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,810
Now you don't need to close the server.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:19,140
Actually you need to keep the server alive for now beginning to do all the configuration but you know

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,130
keep it alive.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,960
Now what I need you to do is to open a new tap again to go right here.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,140
If you're Mac new tab with settings and it will open and you tap inside of waifs already.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,910
Now if you're using the terminal of the code if you're using B as code right here when you go to terminal

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,850
you can open a new one right here by clicking the plus is going to open and you bash.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,040
Right.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,170
And if you're using Windows you just need to go to again command and you will need to navigate to know

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,270
this directory.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,050
Now when we are in sort of waves are going to do CD and then client I'm going to go inside that directory

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,080
inside this directory and we can install right here.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,130
So we do create then react then app and then of course seems I'm already inside the directory.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,470
I'm going to put a dot and I get a press center.

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,460
It's going to take a while and I'll be right back OK so everything was installed.

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,130
So now we need to install the dependencies.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,220
So I'm going to do a clear and remember that on the previous section I gave you a text with all the

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,020
dependencies we need to install.

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,790
So I'm going to make this a little bit bigger and I'm going to paste them right here.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,870
So we will need to install a lot of things we will use Fonte awesome.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,250
So a lot of fun.

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,370
Awesome to use icons.

28
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,130
We use material.

29
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,200
I actually use for making the requests.

30
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,960
Now this re-act images is going to be the light box when we use the light box.

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,600
We have a light box right here.

32
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,500
Maybe it didn't show you right here.

33
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,650
So that is the dependency.

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,310
So we use redux.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,180
We're going to use redux here re-act router we use the slider Riak slick.

36
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,870
And then again redux redux promise we use redux thunk and this Riak drops.

37
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,440
It's where we're going to use this one to upload the images right.

38
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,080
And then we have a moment for time and then we're going to use a different dependency for Pay-Pal because

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,520
we will use Paypal right here a fake Paypal is the sandbox of PayPal so we need to install things.

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,470
So Precentor is going to take a while and I'll be right back.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,640
OK so everything was installed.

42
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,890
So I'm going to do clear.

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,720
And before I start the server again.

44
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,530
Let me close this before I start.

45
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,920
Server a development server or react.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,190
I'm going to go to public remember I gave you this already.

47
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,070
All the links we can all be using.

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,890
I'm going to paste them right now so.

49
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,590
All right.

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,580
So we will use the icons from the front.

51
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:01,930
Awesome.

52
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,780
So we need that CSSA the Google fonts.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
Going to be using.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,080
And the last one the last see SS is going to be for the right here for re-act slick.

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,300
And notice that we are using this CDN.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,180
All right now inside of the source directory.

57
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,580
Going to go right here.

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,480
And we don't need to see a sunken going to delete it.

59
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,030
Just like this.

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,330
What else we we don't need the app that pass that test so I can delete it again.

61
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,050
The index Yes that's not going to really use it.

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,460
Going to trash logo.

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,060
Goodbye just like with the other projects and the service worker I'm going to just delete it.

64
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,770
So I'm going to go to this.

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,880
I'm going to delete this so that this the reference to index's.

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,610
SS Can I save it go to app.

67
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,860
Delete the import for the logo.

68
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,720
Delete the import for the CSSA.

69
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,430
And I'm going to say just my app whatever.

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,350
All right so now let's run the server.

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,540
So I'm going to go right here.

72
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,700
And how can we run it just like with that yarn.

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,280
And I did I did NPM install on the other one.

74
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,350
I'm not really sure.

75
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,760
Now I did remember.

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,490
You always need to NPM if you're using NPM.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,870
So NPM start going to start.

78
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,140
Give it a minute.

79
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,900
OK so everything is working.

80
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,410
We get my app very very good.

81
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,050
Now we have one tiny problem this localhost is going to be 3000.

82
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,490
Right.

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,550
It's the default by react and our server it's working on a different place.

84
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,070
It's working at 0 0 2.

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,760
So right from the start we have the problem that we have this development server every act of the client

86
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,300
in one place and the server our server in a different place.

87
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,360
So just to give you an example.

88
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,260
And what's going to happen what's the problem with this.

89
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,160
I can import ASIO's from ASIO's and it can make a request to our server.

90
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:14,390
So on the component just like this did mount going to open and close.

91
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm going to do actually those dot get opening close and going to make a request to France.

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,260
I just want to get the prints right.

93
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,540
So if you remember it's API.

94
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,130
I don't remember.

95
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,430
Let me say this.

96
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,270
The brands were API product brands.

97
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:40,640
So if I make a request here and then of course we can't the response just like this.

98
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,160
And we run a function I'm going to cancel log whatever response I get.

99
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:55,460
So response in relo the application Embryon the console and on the console we get failed to load we

100
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,460
source to server respond with situs of course your for now right here when we whenever we do this we

101
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,330
are making a request to the server and this server it's in localhost 3000.

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,630
So it's a different location different different domain.

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,360
So we're not going to really work.

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,820
Now what happens if I do.

105
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,120
OK.

106
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,060
My server it's in H.

107
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,030
TTP Kallen forward slash forward slash local host.

108
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,210
Let me do it right.

109
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,500
Localhost host and our server it's in 3 0 0 2.

110
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,660
So I'm going to do 3 0 0 2.

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,380
So this one should work right.

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,000
OK I'm going to make the request.

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Not really happening because you're not allowed to make request requests from your server to a different

114
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,710
server.

115
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,060
If the other server it's not allowing you now instead of here whenever we push production this is going

116
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,030
to be one server a single location.

117
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,940
The problem is that now we react.

118
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,970
We are running the development server.

119
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,610
You're running two servers.

120
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,950
So what do we need to do.

121
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:02,260
We need to modify things a little bit so we can run one server and they can communicate just with one

122
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,560
server.

123
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,850
First I'm going to delete this.

124
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,210
I'm going to delete it and save it.

125
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,580
How can we fix this.

126
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,540
So first I get to go to inside the client.

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,260
I'm going to go inside the package and Jason now react.

128
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,530
They give us the ability to proxy our you know our development server.

129
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,590
So I'm going to do a coma.

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,470
I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to say proxy now proxy.

131
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,350
Of course we need to pass some values.

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,660
What we can do we can set where we want to go.

133
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,550
In this case for I-Slash API for Slash.

134
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,920
So all the routes all the requests from our server from the re-act server going to this location they're

135
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,990
going to target a different place.

136
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:59,380
So Target open it close and it's a TTP call and forward slash force slash and local post 3 0 0 2.

137
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,830
All right what happens if we try again and then reload the application.

138
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,530
Same prom the thing is that we are making changes to package that Jason to this one.

139
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,250
So we need to restart the server.

140
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,220
So I to go to react.

141
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,140
It could kill it and start again.

142
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,440
So now the server is going to refresh.

143
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,940
And now we get a response.

144
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,150
So we are getting a response for data with all the data we need.

145
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,560
Remember I'm not doing console log response data.

146
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,890
If we do it we get the data.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,710
But we are getting the correct response.

148
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,520
This is what we need.

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,980
So now we can make a request to this and every and the application will treat it at the same as the

150
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,420
same server.

151
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,120
And then when we need to push this to production of course we need to change them settings.

152
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,490
But for now this is going to work like a charm.

153
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,170
All right.

154
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,900
So what is the other problem.

155
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:01,630
The other problem is that we have a right here and a batch opened with this with the server and then

156
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,350
we have a different one with our server where our server notes server.

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,950
So it would be wonderful if we could Dron all in the same place.

158
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,380
Right.

159
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,030
OK.

160
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,040
So we can do this now.

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,740
If I go to let me close the client right now if I go to the server to our main package that Jason right

162
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,540
here we've installed something called concurrently.

163
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,420
So concurrently what it does.

164
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:34,570
It can run two different commands at the same time not at the same time but will it will execute one

165
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,060
and then another one with the same command line.

166
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,720
So am I'm going to go right here into the scripts of the package at Chaisson in the main the root directory

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,470
Arayan.

168
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,310
So we have test.

169
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,790
We have start and we have server.

170
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,850
So I'm going to go right here and create a new one which is going to be client.

171
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,520
Now the client will be to will do the NPM run start.

172
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,780
So what do we need to do when it triggered this kind within concurrently.

173
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,640
Then we have to just show you we have a different command which is going to be Deppe and this def will

174
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,370
execute the server command and then the client commands.

175
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,810
Now the client the server inside the client it's inside the client so we need to go to the root and

176
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,560
turn the client and let the application know that we need to run this one inside the client so to do

177
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,720
this we do NPM Bruhn start and we need to specify where we are where can we find this MP from start.

178
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,110
And there's one it's inside the package that Jasen of the client.

179
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,990
All right.

180
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,950
So what we do we do.

181
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,110
Minus minus prefix and then a client.

182
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,880
So pretty much we are going to route.

183
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,360
We are entering client and that we go.

184
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,410
All right.

185
00:10:53,650 --> 00:11:01,750
So inside dev to run the server and declined from the same place we need to use concurrently we have

186
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,770
it right here at the bottom.

187
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm going to paste in it now.

188
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,080
What do we need to do instead of doing a four slash.

189
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,530
We need to do a backslash.

190
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,500
Now if your keyword it's a little bit weird.

191
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,270
And I have this problem in the past.

192
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,490
Someone hired me to do the job.

193
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,000
But I had to go to their office and they gave me a computer.

194
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,070
It was the weirdest computer man.

195
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,140
So you need to copy the one at the top the one of the tests.

196
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,490
All right.

197
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,950
And then paste it.

198
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:36,830
So we do quotes and we add and you quote and what we do we do and PM run server.

199
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,980
If you noticed we are running this command from this command.

200
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,460
This is the idea of this of course I need to close that and I need to add one more one more quote.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,430
Now what I want to do again I want to run the server and the client at the same time.

202
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,990
So I'm going to do space.

203
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm going to do the same thing.

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,250
Open quote and PM run clients now.

205
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,250
Now I'm running this one.

206
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,670
Then of course again and we close it.

207
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,970
And that is it.

208
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:17,140
So now when we do pian run Dev from a single batch concurrently is going to first run the server and

209
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,230
then run the client.

210
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,830
That is what's going to happen.

211
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,730
OK.

212
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,130
So I'm going to go right here to the terminal.

213
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,460
I'm going to kill it.

214
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm going to close it.

215
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,040
I don't need it anymore.

216
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,240
And on this one I'm going to kill it and I'm going to close it get it to clear.

217
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,620
Now I am inside the root directory.

218
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,040
Right.

219
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:47,710
Our main route and now I'm going to do NPM from DEP so NPM or I could do John run def in my case I'm

220
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:56,740
using yarn so I'm going to run it first and you can see it right here concurrently running this too.

221
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,840
So first we start to server.

222
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,950
This is what it's doing.

223
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,570
Sorry it close.

224
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,520
So first we start the server and then it's going to run react.

225
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,850
And that's why the server reloads.

226
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,860
And we have the local host three thousand and we are still able to get the data.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,950
So now you don't need to run two batches you just run one.

228
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,250
And if in the future you need to run more things.

229
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,040
It's just added to concurrently and that's it.

230
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,360
All right man so this is pretty much done now on the next section.

231
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:33,220
We will start building the actual Web site you know adding header footer the body and creating home

232
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,150
and everything else.

233
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,340
So let's go to the next section and start.

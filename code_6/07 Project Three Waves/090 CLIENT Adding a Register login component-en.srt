1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,640
OK so now we're going to do the log in.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,970
I was going to do the sections you know the featured and right this right here.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,910
Just like the discounted promotion.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,280
But you know the log in log out it's a little bit more fun and useful for us right now because after

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,670
we log in and we get no we can know if the user is authenticated or not and show some other routes and

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,690
you know we can do the routes right here.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,670
So we're going to do this.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,020
We're going to go to log in registered log in every district customer.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,510
If not we can go to a different component where we can you know register with the best personal information

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,480
account information and everything everything else.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,400
So OK so first we're going to go and create the register log in route.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,650
All right.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,370
I'm going to close everything here.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,220
I don't need it.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,320
I'm going to go to the index and of course we need to create a component that is going to be ruling

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,350
all of this.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,300
And of course since this is the first section we do forms we will need to do all the form fields and

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,950
everything else so it's going to take a few a few lectures.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,450
Right.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,040
So inside component are going to create a new folder register.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,490
Let me make it right.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,380
With a capital R register and then log in because we will host both things right here.

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,830
Now we will have an index where we can do the actual log in.

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,770
So index that.

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,600
Yes.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,300
And then of course we will create a couple more files.

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,320
So the index yes it's going to be class based component.

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,150
Right.

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,340
Makes sense.

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,240
Could we react to the last component because we didn't have a lot of logic right here.

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,890
So I'm going to do it just like this.

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:51,520
On the other example in the final example I have it is class but we could use a stateless component.

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,870
So I going to call this component register log in just like this.

34
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,030
Or just log in and we can export it.

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,190
And of course we're going to save register log in or something like that whenever So we need to bring

36
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,090
this route to routes.

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:15,870
We need to imported there so I'm going to go two routes and we need to import it so import import and

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,940
register and then log in opening close.

39
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,760
It's going to be from components then just log in and that's it.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,380
Right from.

41
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,250
OK.

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,050
So let's see the routing going it company the one we have so far I'm going to paste it here.

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,260
And then when we have the ability to authenticate users this is going to change a little bit and it's

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,210
going to be different than the previous project.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,710
Can to do it on a different way.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,570
So the route for this calls register log in.

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,320
All right so I'm going to pait paste.

48
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,670
We're just logged in.

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,750
We will use the component register log in.

50
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,920
All right.

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,930
Now if I go to this route on our project let me go here we get wrister So that is good.

52
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,360
So I'm going to go to our component and we need to start doing all of this.

53
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:04,960
All right.

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,320
So first I'm going to rub everything into a div.

55
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm going to call it class name of page and then wrapper.

56
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,880
And this is going to center everything.

57
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,430
And then of course we get a container class name of container.

58
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,290
Actually the page from something else doesn't matter.

59
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,850
Container.

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,390
OK.

61
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,670
So instead of here we get two different things.

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:27,970
Right.

63
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,320
We have the left side.

64
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,480
If we go to the final with new customers and the right side we did register customers.

65
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,150
OK.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,550
So first are going to create a container for this a different kind of container.

67
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,730
So I'm going to call it class name and then register underscore Lagann underscore container.

68
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,510
Doesn't matter right now just C Ss OK.

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,670
So I'm going to create a div opening close and a class name off left just like this.

70
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,820
And of course we have the the left logic right here and I'm going to add the right one right now.

71
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,670
So this one is going to be right.

72
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,790
OK.

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,140
So this one will be h one opening close and new customers.

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,080
All right.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,380
So again we will have some tests.

76
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,880
I have some large ipsum right here which is going to copy and paste.

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,610
I got to put everything inside of a paragraph just like this.

78
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,120
Let me do the word wrap.

79
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,540
Let me paste.

80
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,300
There we go.

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:38,600
So now after the text if you go to the find one we have a button and we have the same button right here.

82
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,820
And then at home same button.

83
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,000
Then pretty much we have all the running balance but we will use the same button several times.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,850
So it kind of makes sense for us to create a reusable component.

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,460
Right.

86
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,000
OK.

87
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,350
So I'm going to store this inside Eutelsat and I'm going to call it button.

88
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,300
So I mean a new file called.

89
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,770
But in that.

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,910
Yes.

91
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,390
OK.

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,950
Of course this button that just is going to be just a function right.

93
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,880
Just a stateless component just a function.

94
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,380
All right.

95
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,660
So going to save it and I'm going to import it import them and I believe I'm going to call it my Bunin

96
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,660
that my band.

97
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,270
Or could be my buttons.

98
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,020
But we are going to you know it's just my button Singler because whenever we request we conclude this

99
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,790
component it will bring just one button so I'm going to say one that you tels for Slash and then button

100
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,010
could be buttons but that's OK.

101
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,210
OK.

102
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,100
So what else.

103
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,810
OK we need to create this.

104
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,810
So what I wanted to do I want to create a component and pass some props we might have different points

105
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,330
for example.

106
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,020
This could was one could be a link or maybe it could be just a button with data link or you could be

107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,380
a button that it's going to trigger you know maybe maybe a function is going to happen with this one.

108
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,160
This one will actually not link when we triggered this.

109
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,140
We're going to go to the database and that this to the card of the user.

110
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,610
So we have different kind of buttons.

111
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,370
For now we're just going to say my button just like this opening close and going to just include this.

112
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,510
We didn't have we didn't have any logic right here but we can add it in a minute.

113
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,280
So I need to know how to paddle the boat in what type of button we're going to use.

114
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,660
So by default we can have one which is the link you know the most used button so I'm going to say type

115
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,890
default and inside button we will create different scenarios as we move forward through the actual project.

116
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,640
Now of course the button needs to say something.

117
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,700
So I'm going to add a prop title and this one will be create an account.

118
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:56,850
Right now since this is a default it's a link we will need to link and then.

119
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,050
And it's equal to forward slash and register.

120
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,890
All right.

121
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,550
We don't have this round we will create it in a few minutes.

122
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,480
Now sometimes we will need to change the stylings of the Bunim for example right now.

123
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,000
We will they all the balance will have the same styling but maybe in the future we want to add a button

124
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,660
that no.

125
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,820
Same thing but with a different background.

126
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:27,350
So we can include the styles property we did before the styles property and begin to pass them see SS

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,230
and of course this will override the default ones.

128
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:38,670
So Martin actually will be merged with the fold once so I'm going to say 10 pixels from the top zero

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,580
0 and 0 that's OK for now.

130
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,610
All right something very simple.

131
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,100
Now of course we need to create all the logic inside the button.

132
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,570
So I'm going to go to button and create out re-act stateless stateless component.

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:02,490
So this one is going to be my button just like this and change the name at the bar on the bottom.

134
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,030
Now this one.

135
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,850
It will return at the very very end.

136
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,970
It's just a button with a class name my link I use this.

137
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,600
This class could be whatever class because it's actually could be my but it makes more sense.

138
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,210
But I've used my linked.

139
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,590
Then you should change it.

140
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,750
But it did.

141
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,850
So this one is going to call function is going to go to a function inside of my button and this function

142
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,720
will decide what kind of a button we want to return.

143
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,170
Right.

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,360
If it's a link or if something else the default it's a link.

145
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,820
That's why you test my link.

146
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:41,100
Then I was when I when I was making this and you know I was advancing through the sections I decided

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,640
to use a component for all the buttons and forgot to change the name of the class.

148
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,090
Right.

149
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,630
That's why we have my leg.

150
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,210
All right.

151
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,750
So now we need to create this function called balance.

152
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,410
So this function the only thing it's going to do is going to check the type of the button we are specifying

153
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,080
right here.

154
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:06,010
And depending on the type we're going to return some GSX and this is what it's going to get return are

155
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,390
at.

156
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,970
So going to create a lot a template to begin this template starts empty.

157
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,810
And of course at the end of the function we will return that template.

158
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,260
Now in the middle of what you will need to do is we need to check the type and if you have a default

159
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,100
we will put that kind of code we want to return.

160
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:32,220
So we did this previously actually on a different practice course talk at Switch we get it checked the

161
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,270
props and the type Actually there are props.

162
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,140
Not this the all complete went wrong there.

163
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,700
OK.

164
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,120
So switch and we always need a default case so if we have a default that actually we didn't get up and

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,770
we are not getting a type or type it's not being recognized by default.

166
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,550
We're going to still say that the template it's equal to nothing.

167
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,940
Or it could be no.

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:56,840
OK.

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,120
So if the case is that we get a default type Then we going to return something.

170
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,760
All right.

171
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,150
So I can open it close.

172
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,780
And in this case actually with this no need to do this.

173
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,470
But that's OK.

174
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,110
I'm going to do this.

175
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,150
And we need to do break.

176
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,720
All right.

177
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,850
So if the case is default I'm going to return that template.

178
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,460
But with some code code inside what are we going to be using.

179
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,200
It's a link.

180
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,030
So I'm going to open and close a link.

181
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,420
All right.

182
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,600
Now we didn't have a link right here.

183
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,270
We need to import it at the top.

184
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:42,900
So import opening close and we can import link for arm and then re-act router.

185
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,630
All right.

186
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,680
Now of course this link needs some configurations so I'm going to go right here.

187
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,090
And first I'm going to be passing the title if you remember we have it inside props.

188
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,260
And then title I'm going to add a class name so class name.

189
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,670
Open it close and the class for this one it's link default.

190
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,080
All right then we have the two property and this is a native property of link.

191
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:14,940
So we need to pass the link and we have it inside prop's that link in that to our link to and then of

192
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,030
course since we have other we are.

193
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,410
We need to overwrite some stylings that we might be attaching with the class name.

194
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,320
We can add the prompts dot at styles.

195
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,000
And this is this is the one that we are passing right here.

196
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,610
Right.

197
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,300
OK.

198
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,800
So in theory this actually should work.

199
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:41,970
So let's go right here and prop's is not defined it's because I'm not passing prompts of course prompts.

200
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,390
All right.

201
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,140
So that's good.

202
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,490
We get the title the text and we get one.

203
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,260
If I go here we go to register.

204
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,730
So that works.

205
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,380
Now this but it is very simple.

206
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,110
We will get different kinds of buttons inside of here just like here we get this button and we have

207
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,250
the ad right here.

208
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,540
This one will trigger function is not a link.

209
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,200
So we're going to do several things.

210
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,910
This file is going to get bigger.

211
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,120
But for now you know this one it's OK.

212
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,020
OK.

213
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,430
So let's go back to the register log in the next part is going to be this one which is the right where

214
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,050
we have the log in code.

215
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,270
So I'm going to go and say age 2.

216
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,770
I'm using it to tack.

217
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,650
So register at customers

218
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:36,180
now inside of the text I'm going to say if you if you have an account please log in for a stand.

219
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,590
And right here we will have the log in you know for pretty much.

220
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,390
So if I save it and go back we get it now we're going to be adding the log in form and we're going to

221
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,310
go to the next section because all the logic of logging in and logging out we are not going to do it

222
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,090
right here.

223
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,770
We're going to do it on a different component which is going to be a class because we need to do a lot

224
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:02,510
of things we need to go to the server or come back and you know we need to do all the form logic.

225
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,430
So let's go to the next section and start with the log in component.

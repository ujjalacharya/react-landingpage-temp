1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,650
OK so we're going to start with the third project of the course.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,130
Now make sure you have everything installed just like robo 3D and postman because we get to use them

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,780
a lot.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,150
If you don't have this an unpretty sections you know previous this section I've added a couple of ones

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,880
into how to install everything in your computer so you know make sure you have all the tools you can

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,960
need.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,560
And of course we will start with a clean project I've entered you know the commander here to that directory

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,870
so we can it run some commands and at the end the very very end we can have something like this so we

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,160
can create a guitar Web site.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,000
So pretty much this side.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,470
They sell guitars.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,400
Why guitars.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,580
I love guitars.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,090
I have tons of guitars.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,650
I've been playing for like more than twenty three or 24 years so I wanted to create a project of something

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,360
I know right.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,240
I wanted to create something because we get to use you know brand pictures and you know the prices and

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,970
categories so I wanted to get to create something.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,270
I have no trouble in creating you know the logic everything else because most of the times when someone

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,160
hires you you need to learn about the product about what they do.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,430
The categories you know you need to learn about a lot of things.

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,780
In this case I've already know that's why I'm creating a guitar website so.

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,200
OK.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,200
So of course we will do a lot of things logons logout everything with Mongo and everything else.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,650
This is my guitar my new guitar.

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,730
So OK.

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,390
So this is going to do at the end but of course whenever we start we need to start from scratch.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,150
So OK.

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,640
So the first thing go to your code your editor or your ID and then just navigate to your directory.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,190
All right.

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,170
So the first thing is to create to create a project.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,030
Now we are not going to use it just now create re-act app.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,210
The first thing we need to do is to create a server because right here this project and we will make

34
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,550
a lot of requests to the server.

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,330
And it's not a firebase server.

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,410
It's going to be a NOIA server with Mongo DVH.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,470
So first the first thing we're going to do before we create the client side of things we will create

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,540
a server.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,260
All right.

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,530
So first we're going to go to this command and we get a trigger and PM in it.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,230
So this will create packaged adjacent in everything else so we can start installing things.

42
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,020
So first NPM in it.

43
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,170
So asked after we do this the package name it's waves.

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,510
Then Burreson just going to keep pressing enter.

45
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,340
Not really important right now.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
And then enter.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,410
And then we get our package that Jason now to run the server.

48
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,010
We need to install one more thing.

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,320
Maybe you don't have this in your computer.

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,460
Maybe you do.

51
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,910
I'm going to install node Monda so NPM install mynahs G and then gnomon.

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,410
I could use your brain going and I'm going to use NPM.

53
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,710
So what.

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,180
No.

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,210
Mon Dieu.

56
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,580
When we run a server right.

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,770
We're going to of course have a file right here and the server is going to be running OK.

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,560
So if we make a change on the file then we need to kill the server from the command and start the server

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,520
manually.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,600
So gnomon what it does is going to listen to your files and whenever you make a change it will restart

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,460
the server of the medically.

62
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,160
That is the idea because of course we don't want to go back be a back and forward to the terminal to

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,580
do everything manually.

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,300
So I'm going to do clear but we're going to use this later.

65
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,850
Right.

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,350
OK.

67
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,640
So inside our project we have two different points the client side of things and the server.

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,230
So I'm going to create two different directories one with client and another one with server.

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,000
Right.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,900
And of course we need to install a lot of dependencies before we start.

71
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,850
So OK so inside waves because this is the main directory we're going to install pretty much everything

72
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,490
for the server and everything else when we go to the client we can enter the client directory and we

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,970
can install them there.

74
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,030
For now this is good.

75
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,780
OK.

76
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,510
So inside of ways I gave you on the press section a note where you have the commands of what we need

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,430
to install.

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm going to bring it right here.

79
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,870
So I'm going to make this a little bit bigger because we have a lot of lines.

80
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,030
So this is what we need to install.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Decrypt is to encode passwords and hash passwords and everything else.

82
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,750
Body parts are something we do with the express.

83
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,880
Then of course we install express to use the server.

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,100
We get to much much later you use close Narey and I will show you later on a bonus section how to upload

85
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,660
images instead of using clone Cloncurry to your directory to use your server.

86
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,510
I will not recommend this but if you want to do it you can do it concurrently.

87
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,830
Again we're going to check this later.

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,210
It's very specific cookie parser's something that we use with a server that EMV is decreed embarkment

89
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,080
virals.

90
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:12,740
And then of course Jason Webb tokens to create web tokens moment for times for parsing times and mongoose.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,190
And then of course MULHER it's pretty much something we use to upload images.

92
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,740
We will do this at the very very end.

93
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,930
So are going in this what are we going to need to to use in our server.

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,490
So going to press center it's going to take a while and I'll be right back.

95
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
OK so everything was install.

96
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm going to do.

97
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,260
Clear and right now we need to define which file is going to be the main entry of our application.

98
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,610
In this case is going to be inside server.

99
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,770
So inside server it will create a file called Server dodgiest.

100
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,130
And this is the main starting point of our server.

101
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,740
Now before we start anything we need to tell the application our project where are we going to be starting.

102
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,570
Just like would we do would react when we do NPM run or start.

103
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,310
Well same thing right here.

104
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,790
So we need to go to the package that Jason and start enter enter the logic right here so we can have

105
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,660
two commands.

106
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,360
First we have start which is opening close.

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,730
And this one it's equal to starting the server.

108
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,100
So we do node then server just like this for Slash and then server Dungey asked which is the name of

109
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,920
our file.

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,960
So whenever we do NPM start we will go to start the application is going to go to start and start there

111
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,150
from this file.

112
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,330
So the server is going to run.

113
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,940
The thing is that again if we do this we need to go every time we make a change on the server then yes

114
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,380
we need to kill the server and start again.

115
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,290
And I don't do that.

116
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,100
So I'm going to do coma and I'm going to create a new command which is going to be server now server

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:58,450
instead of using node the start server Dungey as is going to do gnomon and then server that jazz non-jazz.

118
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,150
So this ones are pretty much the same thing.

119
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,250
The difference is that this one uses node and this one uses gnomon and we are going to use this one.

120
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,850
Gnomon.

121
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,950
So now whenever we want to run the server we do NPM or yaun start at run and then server.

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,720
All right.

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:14,990
OK.

124
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,490
That is not going to save this.

125
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,030
Now of course if we do this nothing is going to happen to close the console.

126
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,790
Nothing nothing is going to happen because we don't have any logic in site server.

127
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,990
So OK.

128
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,370
We need to we need to start doing some things.

129
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,820
So first we need to create an express application sorry for this.

130
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,880
We need to create an express application.

131
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,400
Right.

132
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:46,860
So first Konst and then express it's equal to require open and close and we say Xpress just like this.

133
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,000
All right.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
What else.

135
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,430
For now nothing else.

136
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm going to say Konst I'm going to say app and what we do inside app we can host the instance of what

137
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,630
we are bringing from Express.

138
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,630
We just fire everything.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,760
So Express just like this.

140
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,650
Open it close.

141
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,530
And then we start an express instance right here on app.

142
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,080
All right.

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,070
So now whenever we want to use something using the exper server we make a reference to an app and you

144
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,350
know then do something whatever doesn't matter.

145
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,890
OK that is good.

146
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,890
Now for now the only thing we need to do is to create a server now the server needs a port.

147
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,120
So I'm going to say Konst then port calls and now we need an environment Barville I'm going to quit

148
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,650
right now.

149
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,360
We didn't have it.

150
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,090
We can add it in a few minutes.

151
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,880
So I'm going to say I want to enter the process which is an environment viable and I want to bring to

152
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,840
port.

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,270
Now if we don't have this I want to run this on a different place and I'm going to run it on the port

154
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:53,550
three you to then we can use this app that we brought right here and say OK I want to start an app and

155
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,580
I want this application to listen for something and listen to the port.

156
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,330
I just create it at the top.

157
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,750
This viral now of course after this happens are going to create a callback.

158
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,700
This you can add this if you want.

159
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,800
It doesn't really matter.

160
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,640
And the only thing we're going to do right here is going to say console log and use tempera strings

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,220
here server running.

162
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,210
And this is you know pretty common.

163
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,320
And then I passed port which is equal to whatever we are running right here.

164
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,000
The environment larval port or the three us you are too.

165
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,640
All right let's get.

166
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,650
So if I save this and I start our application at least we should be getting a message of server running

167
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,910
and running.

168
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,940
So we do server.

169
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,230
OK.

170
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,550
So I'm going to go right here and do.

171
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:54,850
Clear again and then your own run server and a presenter and no one is going to start

172
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,150
and that we get this OK.

173
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:08,070
No don't we start at any time and we get server running at 3 0 0 2 so everything works.

174
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,910
This means that our server is actually running really simple really simple stuff.

175
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,060
So let me bring the other one.

176
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,740
OK.

177
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,940
So now we know that we are running.

178
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,740
We're running a server on the local host 3 0 0 2.

179
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,070
So I'm going to go through 2 3 0 0 2 and we can get this.

180
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,520
So if you're getting cannot get it's actually OK.

181
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,220
This port is being used but by our server but we don't have any logic right here saying that whenever

182
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,630
you get a request for this location you know show something on the screen.

183
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,840
And this is what we're going to do much much later with the client.

184
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,150
This part the server dodgiest the only thing is that it's going to do is going to listen for four slash

185
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,400
API and then whatever it is that we want to get.

186
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,070
But of course we need to do this first.

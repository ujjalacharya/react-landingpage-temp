1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,350
So now we need to create this update form function.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:04,940
Right.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,760
And now is going to slow a little bit because we're going to do it on a different way.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,560
It's pretty much the same idea but we can host everything on a different file.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:24,440
So I'm going to go to you Telles form and I will create a new file called form actions that Jack's right

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,340
here we're going to include all the logic.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,510
So now whenever we do this this update form and I need you to remember this we are passing this bar

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,430
this argument the element and this element contains the event on the of the change or the on blur and

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,800
contains an ID and contains a blur right.

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,940
In the case of Blart which is true by default and the ID is going to be you know what is the name of

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,200
the form field.

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,520
In this case e-mail.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,200
All right.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,500
So whenever we go to update form I'm going to go right here.

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,600
We're going to be doing is just call to a function call to an outside function so we can validate all

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,450
of this.

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:09,370
So I'm going to say Konst new form data data when we do it like this data.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,110
And this one is going to be equal to a function.

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm going to call it update.

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,860
You can call this whatever you want.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,460
Not update form just update just like this.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,290
The hour to complete is just breaking my balls.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,550
Sorry for that update.

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,490
OK.

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,290
So this update is going to be just a function and this function will receive three different arguments

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,690
element which is the actual element we get from the from here element.

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,920
So we're going to pass it.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
We going to pass it.

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,980
And now what do we need to do we need to send the copy of the state of thinks of the state of form data.

30
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:53,350
So the second argument is going to be this that state that form data and as the third argument just

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,980
in case because we might need it in the future going to be passing what is a type of forum that you

32
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,720
know it's performing this action.

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,820
This is triggering the update.

34
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,410
And in this case it's going to be log in because we are on the log in component.

35
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,410
All right.

36
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,200
Now we don't have this function so we need to create it and we're going to go to form actions and start

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,300
creating all the logic for us.

38
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,500
So we're going to go right here at the bottom and say Konst and we need to create a viable that's you

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,090
know and we need to export actually export Konst.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
And it's called update.

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,200
So this update is just a function and it's going to be receiving.

42
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:41,630
If you remember the element just like this coma a form data form data coma and the form name which is

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,910
the idea that we are not going to really use right now.

44
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,800
So first what we need to do we need to grab this form data and mutate it.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,230
Now what I want to do I want to create a new form data just like we did previously because I don't want

46
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:04,020
to change the original that we are getting from the prompts we could do it but I don't really want to.

47
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,520
So dot dot dot and we say that this one is going to be equal to form data.

48
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,030
So now we can mutate form data a form date whatever we will as much as we want.

49
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,190
And we are not going to be mutating the original argument.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,050
All right.

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,610
So now what we need to do.

52
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,730
I'm going to create a contest and then new elements of this new element is going to be whatever you

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,110
know to be equal to whatever field we have inside this form data.

54
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,260
When we make it right form data but it's going to be equal to the key of whatever we are getting remember

55
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,510
that this element has the ID.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
And in this case it's going to be email.

57
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,360
So I'm going to say OK.

58
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,770
Inside the new element.

59
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,770
I just want to store the ID data so I can access the new form data you know the copy we have.

60
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm going to say I want to put inside whatever I have to get inside the element and ID.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,700
So this one is going to be check the email data.

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,390
We have D.M. state we have inside for data.

63
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,720
And of course if you have password you're using passwords there's going to be you it's going to be the

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,470
passport on the next component that begin to do here.

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,910
And I'm going to do it right now.

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,970
Why not.

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:20,450
So form field and remember that this one is password and this one is passport and that is it.

68
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,050
So OK.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,020
But we're going to take the e-mail for example as a reference right now.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,500
Now since we have a copy of the new elements we can mutate the element as much as we want.

71
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,630
So I'm going to go to new elements.

72
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,820
I'm going to enter the value and remember that inside of the element we have the event that we get back

73
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,820
from foreign fields and right here from the onchange and employer.

74
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,690
So I'm going to say OK now the value change that changed.

75
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,280
So I'm going to say elements I can access the event that target and this is you know just just javascript

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,130
the element at Target and the value.

77
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,750
So now new element has the new value of thanks.

78
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,650
All right.

79
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,130
Now of course we need to do a few more things we need to check if the information is valid.

80
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,570
So we need to add some validation right now remember that we use that PLR right here.

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,250
And this one is going to change you know if it's PLUR.

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,190
So if the element was was selected.

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,370
You know we went inside of the.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,900
Let me show it right here.

85
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,860
When we went inside and then outside then the blur changed everything to true.

86
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,890
So now this property right here this e-mail for example will have a blur of true ride.

87
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,620
This one right here.

88
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,550
So later we can check if the element had a blur or of true or not.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,420
So if the element has a blur of true it means that the user clicked on it and went outside or clicked

90
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,030
enter some information and then went outside.

91
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,880
Since now it's going to be true because the user did that.

92
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,670
We need to start validating and not before that.

93
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,490
So I'm going to say opening close.

94
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:07,700
So if the user of course did the blur element dot blur we can do symbolization later of course we will

95
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,220
change the state of things because right here remember that we have touched so touched it's kind of

96
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,320
like the blur.

97
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,040
There's one is false but at the end of this form actions is going to be true.

98
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,940
All right.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,690
So now we need to create something so we can validate.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,120
So I'm going to say let valid data that there's valid data is going to be equal to a different function

101
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,140
called validate.

102
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,570
So we don't I don't know what it's doing this is just I need to delete a lot of plugins.

103
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,600
Valley date.

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,540
All right.

105
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,200
So this validate is going to be just a function that we're going to be creating in a couple of minutes

106
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,260
so export cans.

107
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,840
Yeah.

108
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:56,900
Sorry mental breakdown and then validate and you know just going to be a function.

109
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,620
All right.

110
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,130
So this validate is going to do a few things.

111
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,540
And it needs something from here so we can start checking because you need to enter the state of the

112
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,650
actual field and check what are the rules that it needs to validate.

113
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,090
All right.

114
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,780
So what are we going to be passing.

115
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:18,260
Is it new elements which contains all this rules and then coma and it going to be passing the form data

116
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,710
later you're going to see why right now we're not going to really use it.

117
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,130
Of course this function is going to fail because you have nothing.

118
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,990
Now this bad data is going to be returning an array.

119
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,740
Right.

120
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,830
Let's do the validate first because not just going to tell you something that doesn't exist.

121
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,190
So it's kind of hard to understand.

122
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,830
All right.

123
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,110
So let's go to the Vulg. and do it right now.

124
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,930
So this validate will be receiving an element which is the new element and it's going to be receiving

125
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,980
a form data.

126
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,260
Now if we don't have form data the form data by default is going to be empty.

127
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,730
So form data data equals an empty array.

128
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,290
All right.

129
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,350
Now if you remember at the end we will read we will return an array and this array will have two things.

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,950
If it's Mallat which is a boolean true or false.

131
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,030
And the second position of the array is going to be the actual error message.

132
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,670
So let error and this is going to start as true.

133
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:26,240
In this case and the second error in the second value is going to be that the actual error message.

134
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,790
So by default the input is going to be valid because we have true and no error messages.

135
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,550
All right let's go right here and I'm going to do the required because it's the easiest one.

136
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,180
After that after we do we have the required.

137
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,290
Everything else is going to be really easy.

138
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:49,250
So what we return at the end this function is going to return an array with this or with something else.

139
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,930
All right.

140
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:58,170
So what we need to do first we need to check if we have a required validation inside the actual element.

141
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,090
We go back.

142
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,940
We can see that we enter validation and we have a required.

143
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:12,380
So if we do have inside of the elements that are validation just like this validation that and it's

144
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,810
called.

145
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,850
And we have one that that is if required then we're going to do something.

146
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,890
So we create Konst valid and viable cons.

147
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,800
And this one is going to be equal to the value of the elements and we will check if the you know if

148
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,900
we do have something.

149
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:36,630
So first I'm going to say OK this one is going to be true or false only if the element that value exists.

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,450
Now I'm going to say that I'm going to trim it to remove the white spaces and if it's different than

151
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,690
nothing.

152
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,210
So right here we are trimming the value of the actual element and we are checking if it's empty or not.

153
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,290
So if it's if it's not empty it's going to be true.

154
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,280
And if it's empty it's going to be false and it's valid it's going to be equally false.

155
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,180
And is it.

156
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,650
And when we return the error we will check it right here and we will return or not.

157
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,540
All right.

158
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,630
Now remember that we have a message.

159
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,600
So I'm going to say message and this message will be just a template strings to string.

160
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,330
So opening close.

161
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:24,430
Now if it's not valid then we want to return an error message you're going to use a tertiary right here.

162
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,140
If it's not if it's you know false.

163
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,730
We want to return this something something silly.

164
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,500
This field is required.

165
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,730
Let's get.

166
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,270
Of course if we don't have an error message it means that it's valid.

167
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
We're going to return nothing.

168
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,520
Pretty simple.

169
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,350
This is just javascript it's just logic.

170
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,620
So I'm going to say error.

171
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,960
And now we want to do we want to return this.

172
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,580
Whether you have false or true or whatever.

173
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,070
So what are we going to be sending right here.

174
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,470
It's not just this of course we're going to do something else.

175
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,330
We're going to say OK if it's not valid which is it which means that we have errors.

176
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,160
When are we going to send an array with the valid which is going to be false.

177
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,820
And the actual message that we get from here are right.

178
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:18,170
If not we're going to send the default error that we have at the top which is true and nothing.

179
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,310
Now I'm going to go back to log in and I can let know.

180
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,150
Just change remove the email right now so we can get a validation check for required and make sure that

181
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,130
you know everything works.

182
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,430
Now let's go back to the elemental are now this valid data will be returning true or false and a message.

183
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,200
Or maybe no message depending on the back nation of course.

184
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:46,480
So after we do that we need to start changing things inside of the value right here.

185
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,160
The Valot and validation message and teched because of course we are updating these fields.

186
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,970
The state got.

187
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:02,630
So after valid data are going to enter new element going to Siddhant I'm going to say valid equals and

188
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,790
remember that this valid data returns in a rate so going to save body data opening close and I want

189
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:13,360
to know when to get the first banya which is true or false depending if it's valid or not.

190
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,080
Then remember we have a validation message so that and right here we have the validation message.

191
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,590
I'm going to say OK now the validation message.

192
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,600
Going to be equal to whatever we get back from Bali that data and the position number one right there.

193
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:37,360
The error message and then after this says we get beat we actually touched the element.

194
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:43,070
We're going to say that the new element that touched just like this.

195
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,910
It's equal to whatever we get from element player.

196
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,440
Which is true right now.

197
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,310
Remember that on the form field we are saying true on this one we are not really saying true so if we

198
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,260
get to this point and we didn't trick a trigger on nobbler this one is going to be false of course.

199
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:09,200
All right so I'm going to go right here but I'm not going to say OK now the new form data has a new

200
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,650
element.

201
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,850
Remember that we are storing.

202
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,600
We're making all the changes inside a new element so we need to put this new element inside new form

203
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,590
form data.

204
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,480
All right so going to enter your form data.

205
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,720
I'm going to open it close and I'm going to make a reference to the element that Id remember.

206
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,190
We have it the we have the ID right here.

207
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,310
Since we are inside there we need to say OK now all this information changed and it's equal to element

208
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,180
of two new elements.

209
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,250
All right so we have a new state of form data.

210
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,160
So we're not going to do.

211
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,520
I'm going to return that form data because it's a return form data from data.

212
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,870
So this one will contain all the changes it's going to be pretty much a copy of all of this.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,200
But with all the changes w the valley at the touch the validation message.

214
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,340
We have an error message.

215
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,900
All right.

216
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:03,050
So now on this function on this update form we are getting back this new state of things right.

217
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:12,870
So what we want to do is just said the state so this that set state when it's going to be a form error.

218
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,030
Begin to turn it to False just in case and then we going to passing the formed data and the form data

219
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,390
is equal to new form data.

220
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:31,610
So the update States at the state and we will get the I'll get up to date update.

221
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,910
It's not defined it's because I didn't include this at the top.

222
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,980
Very nice.

223
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,560
All right.

224
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,580
Well that's.

225
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,990
So import opening close.

226
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:51,410
Update for mom and dad that you tell us for Slash form for Slash form actions.

227
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,330
All right let's see if we get everything working.

228
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,250
So if I type something I should be able to see something right here in the works.

229
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
Right.

230
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,550
And if I remove everything we go to that on blur.

231
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,180
Of course not.

232
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,410
OK so this works.

233
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,190
Now the thing is that this actually has an error state.

234
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,250
But the problem is that now inform feels we are not catching the error.

235
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,950
We are not showing anything.

236
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,590
Let's do it real quick because it's going to be real simple.

237
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:27,740
So after the after the input I'm going to say I want to run a function that calls show error.

238
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,740
So this error is going to be just a function that of course is going to be checking the form data.

239
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,980
So OK I'm going to go before the render template Konst show error.

240
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,600
It's going to be just as you call to a simple function.

241
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,500
We are almost done.

242
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,070
All right.

243
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,300
So I'm going to say let error message and this message at the beginning is going to be null.

244
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,860
We are pretty much doing the same thing here.

245
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,590
So it's going to be No.

246
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,980
Now if open and close if the form data that we are getting right here has validation because some inputs

247
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,870
might not have a location then we want to move forward.

248
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,960
Remember that on the log in we have validation.

249
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,850
All right.

250
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,780
So we do have a day on this one.

251
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,920
We're going to move forward.

252
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,490
But I want to check something else and I'm going to say ampersands let me find it.

253
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,230
All right.

254
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,350
Ampersand.

255
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,700
And if the form data just like this it's equal to false inside of the ballot then we want to show it.

256
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,930
So we're going to say that we're going to grab this message and we will be returning some GSX because

257
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,670
we need to put it here.

258
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,710
And this one is going to be equal to a div with an Arab label.

259
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,330
So class name opening close.

260
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,360
Error level and inside.

261
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Remember that we have a validation message that we are attaching from within form within form actions.

262
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,240
So we are going to say that this one it's equal to form data dot validation.

263
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,750
And let me copy to avoid mistakes cubby very good.

264
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,900
It's equal to form data and validation message.

265
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,950
And at the end of course.

266
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,410
Never forget to return the actual error message with no or with the Gas-X.

267
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,160
All right.

268
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,980
Real fast.

269
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,360
So if I type something and go out we get the field is required.

270
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,310
All right.

271
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,650
If I type something it goes away.

272
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,390
If I click go outside this field is required.

273
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:28,980
All right.

274
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,300
Let me check if the section went long ok.

275
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,950
Not that that long.

276
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,540
So if you remember the e-mail it's actually required.

277
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,060
It's actually we have a rule for this one which is e-mail and then true.

278
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,440
Remember we had this.

279
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,230
So we need to add the validation right here in some form actions and we're going to do it really really

280
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,670
really quick.

281
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,410
Now I'm going to go right here the top this one needs to be the last one.

282
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,280
All right.

283
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,760
I'm going to go.

284
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:06,210
If I open it close if element it validation it's equal you know just like this.

285
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,980
Then we want to do something now pretty much begin to do the same thing here.

286
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,870
So I got a copy.

287
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,190
I'm going to paste.

288
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,370
Of course this rules are going to be different.

289
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,340
So I'm going to delete this.

290
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,390
I'm going to say OK it's going to be valid and we're going to use some regs.

291
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,970
Now you can go to the Web site I'm sorry the Web site to the web and try to find some rag X to validate

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,190
e-mails because you know typing this just here.

293
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,950
It's just silly.

294
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,960
Just go to the web find it if you type Reg X and then email validation.

295
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,020
The first one that you get is going to be good.

296
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,810
All right.

297
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:46,140
So first we're going to do this reg X and we're going to do test opening closed and what are we going

298
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,600
to be testing.

299
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,940
Is the element that value.

300
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:59,020
Now if we of course if it's not valid again to say must be a valid email.

301
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,950
All right.

302
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,290
And of course this one will stay the same.

303
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,150
If it's not valid we will return an array if not an error.

304
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,260
All right.

305
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,160
Let's get.

306
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,090
So I'm going to save it and let's see if it works.

307
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,270
If I type nothing and go Tydfil is required if I type something and go away.

308
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,310
Must be a valid email and if I do G-mail that COM it works.

309
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:29,100
Now remember that on this side of things on the site on the server side inside the models with the users

310
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,980
we are already validating this.

311
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,390
So if we make a mistake a mistake right here this will not go to the server because the server will

312
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,490
check that schema.

313
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,300
The data that matches what we are doing right here that you know that emails type of string and everything

314
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,020
else.

315
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,240
So again if there is something wrong we have a second layer of validation with the with the server.

316
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,970
All right.

317
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,590
OK.

318
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,900
That is that is.

319
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,630
So let's go to the next section and begin to do of course we're going to keep doing this.

320
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,270
We're going to try to finish the form and then of course we will do that request to register to log

321
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,190
in the server the user.

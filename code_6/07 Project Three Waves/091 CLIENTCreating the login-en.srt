1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,840
OK so let's read the log in component.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:12,260
So I'm going to create a new file called log in that J.S. of course log in that yes and of course this

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,080
one could be.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,090
It's going to be a re-act classic class based component.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,350
And I'm going to call it luggin makes sense right now.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,070
We need to import a lot of things.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,350
But first we need to create a lot of things.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,820
So the only thing getting port right here because we're going to use it later it's disconnect because

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,440
after we look again you know we are trying to log in we need to go to the server and check if the user

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,050
has the correct passport and e-mail and everything else.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,260
So we're going to use redux.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,800
All right.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,250
So whenever we use a connect we need to go right here on the bottom and say we want to connect it and

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,510
then we're going to open it close and pass the name of the components.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,180
All right.

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,620
That is great.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,960
So now I'm going to go right here Rick in the middle and say class name equals to sign in just like

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,840
this and then wrapper.

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,290
And then of course I'm going to bring a form.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,900
So I'm going to say for open and close remember that when we do submit we have we have an answer.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,100
Handler.

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,060
Now on the previous projects we did this on a different way.

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,400
Now they all submit all the functions and all the checking right here.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,140
Well actually doing this on the actual components.

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,580
Now you're going to do a different thing.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,920
We're going to use reusable components we're going to outsource all the checking of all the forms inside

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,580
the project.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,700
So this selfmade form we don't have this function of course and we will be passing an event.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,070
Right.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,910
So you get a copy of event and paste it right here.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,930
When you have a function I'm just going to say submit form equals to a function and not return nothing

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,680
for now.

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,690
OK.

34
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,810
So if you remember we have form fields and we use a reusable components for this.

35
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,850
But for this we need to have a state first with all the forms we need to all the form fields we need.

36
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,780
And as in this case we will have to the email and the passport.

37
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,610
So I'm going to go right here and create a state opening clause.

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,350
We can do this on the priest project so this should be easy right now.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,150
So we have a form error.

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,690
If we get an error at the end of course is going to start is false.

41
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,290
All right.

42
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,310
Then we have a form success form success just like there is success and it's going to be equal right

43
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,110
now to nothing because at the beginning it's empty.

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,430
If you get a success you can show a message right here.

45
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,280
Now then we have the form data.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,980
So inside of the form data we have all the elements.

47
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,400
So I'm going to go nuclear create an email and then we have a passport.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,660
We're going to do it later.

49
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,920
So for this one we need to tell the elements.

50
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,430
So I'm going to say that the element of this is going to be an input.

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,350
All right.

52
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,550
They're going to do koma are going to select the value and the value of this is going to start ads nothing

53
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,100
that we need to pass some confect to this.

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,400
Just like that before and each input has a you know some options some attributes like the name and the

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,200
name is going to be in this case email input.

56
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,780
You know just a regular.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,280
The other one is going to be type and the type of this its e-mail you know because an email input and

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,650
then going to add a placeholder place holder open and close.

59
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,000
And you know enter your email.

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,070
Now of course will have some validation so we need to add some validation rules.

61
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:43,030
So open it close and we're going to say that this one it's required and it's true.

62
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,210
All right.

63
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,150
And then one then we can add a new rule which is e-mail true we need to validate that the user is entering

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,070
a valid e-mail.

65
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,100
All right.

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,370
We are almost done.

67
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,850
So we need to tell.

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,610
We need to know if the element is valid at the end.

69
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,620
So it's going to start false as soon as we start we start entering information the validation will kick

70
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,960
in and a little changed of ballad to true of course.

71
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,450
Now we need to add the touched so we can now we can skip that validation right away.

72
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,440
And at the end we're going to add a validation and then message.

73
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,190
All right.

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,350
So it's going to start.

75
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,660
It's nothing because we don't get any errors.

76
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,200
If you get an error we're going to store it right here.

77
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,970
All right.

78
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,520
So I got a copy this one.

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,860
We're going to put a comma and paste it right here.

80
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,550
So now we need to do the passport.

81
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,410
So this one is going to be password the type of input.

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,520
But instead of e-mail I'm going to copy a keyboard.

83
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,960
It's going to be passport and passport and passport but it isn't required.

84
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,290
It's not an e-mail just required.

85
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,500
And that's it.

86
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,260
That's it for the state.

87
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,880
So now what we need to do we need to create a usable component that is going to take the form data and

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,410
it's going to show the e-mail if we are passing an e-mail and the passport for passing a passport.

89
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:01,980
Right.

90
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,470
All right.

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,920
So first just like we did before.

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,110
I'm going to go the bottom and start we can put in we don't have this component.

93
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,200
Are we're going to do it now so we can know what we need to be passing to that components.

94
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,800
So we're going to call it foreign field form field just like we did before opening close.

95
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,430
And this forum feel we need to pass the I.D. of you know what we want to add in this case on this one

96
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,070
we're going to just add e-mail.

97
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,230
We need to pass the form data so we can to say form data equals opening close this that state that form

98
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,300
data.

99
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,250
And you know the actual input in this case we are passing all the data of the e-mail and then whenever

100
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,290
this is change of course we need to run a function.

101
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,470
So I'm going to open and close and we're going to be passing the element and we're going to run a function

102
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,780
to update the the form so update and then form.

103
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,580
And of course things from this form field we will receive an element we need to pass the element to

104
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,700
update form.

105
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,260
All right.

106
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,040
So we don't have this function going to go right here at the top and create an empty function so we

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,530
can skip that error message.

108
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,190
All right.

109
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,860
So now we need to create the form field component.

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,350
So of course we're going to do this in details and we are going to have to have a lot of things for

111
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,990
forms.

112
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,040
So I will store this inside of a directory and inside of forms of course we will add the form field.

113
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,660
So could open and close.

114
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,670
Am I going to call it form field dodginess.

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,030
All right now I'm going to go back again and I'm going to include this right here sample.

116
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:56,690
So import form of capital F field from that dot for Slash utils for Slash form for Slash form field.

117
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,830
All right.

118
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,470
So I got to go back to I'm going to go to Fairfield's and we need to add all the logic right here at

119
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,200
the top.

120
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,470
So this one is going to be a re-act stateless component.

121
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,940
It's just a function.

122
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,100
And I'm going to change the capital F to form field.

123
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,200
All right.

124
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,860
So from the from the actual components from this one at the bottom we will receive three different things.

125
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,470
So I'm going to make use of the structuring and I get to say that I want to get the form data form data

126
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,260
coma.

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,830
I want to get that change.

128
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,580
Now I want to get the idea.

129
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,300
All right.

130
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,770
Form data change in ID.

131
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,690
Very good.

132
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,350
So can it go right here at the bottom.

133
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,940
And now whenever we return something we need to do some logic first since we need to figure out what

134
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,210
are going to be returning.

135
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,410
So we're going to say render template just like we did before.

136
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,140
All right.

137
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,370
So this render template is going to be just a function.

138
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:03,680
So I'm going to go right here at the top and say Konst and render a template There you go it's going

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,580
to be just a function opening close.

140
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,520
So first just like we did with the button we need to decide what are we going to be returning.

141
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,760
In that case we have an input.

142
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,550
You know we have this an input.

143
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,720
We're going to return an input.

144
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,630
We have a text area or maybe a different select for example but we just have input so for now we're

145
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,720
going to create one single case and when we get a select for example on the admin side of things we

146
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,900
will create that inside form field.

147
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,470
But for now we just have one.

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,840
So let's form a template.

149
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,090
It's going to start empty.

150
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,850
Or you can put.

151
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,180
No no we did empty with a button where you can return no.

152
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,870
It's completely up to you.

153
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,790
And at the end we will return return this form template.

154
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,490
All right.

155
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,460
So in the middle just like you're looking for you're going to do a switch.

156
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,030
So inside the switch we need to check what we're going to be using for you know checking.

157
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,990
And it's inside for data form data on each element.

158
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,420
And in this case inside elements right.

159
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,650
So impot So we're going to do that.

160
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,170
So we're going to grab that form data and we're going to check the elements on it.

161
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:24,110
Of course if you have a default as an area we always need to do default opening close and we return

162
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,010
the form template with again.

163
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,570
So we just set it back to nil.

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,760
Now if the case is that we do have something in this case we will be putting input.

165
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,520
Say what we need right now.

166
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,210
So if the case we have an input.

167
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,830
Of course never forget forget to do the break.

168
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,490
If the case that we have an input begin to say OK well if we have an input.

169
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,870
Now the form template it's going to be different.

170
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,520
It's going to be different to something else.

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
Now what are we going to do.

172
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,770
We're going to be returning some GSX.

173
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,660
So I'm going to open it close right then because we need to do some ternary operations right here.

174
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,130
So we need to use this and not just just a component or maybe a dip.

175
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,640
All right.

176
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,760
So what we will be returning is going to be a dip in the distance.

177
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,330
Has a class name off form and then block it.

178
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,620
Now of course we will be returning and impot in this case.

179
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,290
And he said of the input we need to put all the configurations inside log in we have the config with

180
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,270
the name type in place holder.

181
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:34,440
So right at the beginning of that that that formed data just like this data dart and config.

182
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,910
And we will you know by default do all of this attach all the properties from data that confect our

183
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,160
what else we need to add value and let me do this.

184
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,860
All right.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,500
So now we need a value.

186
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,730
If you remember inside the form data we do have a value and it's inside form data diet value.

187
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,670
I know maybe you went you did this on the first project and on the second project.

188
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,770
So I'm kind of repeating myself because maybe you didn't do the first one or the second one.

189
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,230
You were interested in the.

190
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,100
And there's one.

191
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,820
So you know I'm just going it's not that slow but you know explaining what I'm doing.

192
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,660
So we have a tumbler and an on change you know whenever we change we will update right here.

193
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,560
Let me go.

194
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,960
We will update the form but we also have a number.

195
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,930
And with the blurb going to do a couple things so well first we're going to be passing the event of

196
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,500
on Blar And then of course we're going to trigger this change because whenever we do on blur we actually

197
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,820
change the form and we're going to be passing the an object.

198
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,060
So with that object we pass the event so we can catch de-value then we're going to be passing the ID

199
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,340
and at the end we're going to be passing on a blur.

200
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,050
And I'm going to say true all right now I'm going to do onchange

201
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,080
open close and now of course this one makes no sense.

202
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,020
We will get there don't worry because we need to do it in context.

203
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:16,340
Now on this one we will be passing the event and pretty much do the same thing.

204
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,430
So I'm going to copy now just to save some time.

205
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,450
I'm going to delete the blogger.

206
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,980
We don't need it right here.

207
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,400
So every time we are doing change all we do on blur we will fire this function that will update the

208
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,190
state of the form data and we will see the changes reflected right here.

209
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,290
In the case of on Bloor which is which means that we click on the on the form and we go out we will

210
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,520
need to check if the if the input it's empty or not.

211
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,880
That's why we are passing on a blur.

212
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,050
We can check if this event it's a type of change and blur and begin to you know show the validation

213
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,840
message saying did you need to enter something here.

214
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,860
That that's pretty much it.

215
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:05,820
Now of course if I save this and I go to our component nothing is going to happen because we didn't

216
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,670
include this.

217
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,210
All right.

218
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,300
So I'm going to go to the register and include the log in.

219
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:22,770
So import Lochend from DOT for Slash and Lagann and right here are going to make a reference to log

220
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,180
in.

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:23,720
All right.

222
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,400
Open it close.

223
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,640
So let's see what we get.

224
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:26,880
OK.

225
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,270
We get another e-mail.

226
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,220
Of course if I type something nothing's going to happen I'm typing.

227
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,850
Nothing is going to happen because we need to do something to that update form.

228
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,240
All right.

229
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,420
So OK.

230
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,410
So what we need to do.

231
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,910
Let's first do the update form and then add the errors and everything else.

232
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,600
The section went too long.

233
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,980
Yeah it went a little too long.

234
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,230
So let's go to the next one and do the update form and we still need to do something else right here

235
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,660
because if you have an error message maybe validation message we need to display it.

236
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,170
So we need to complete this.

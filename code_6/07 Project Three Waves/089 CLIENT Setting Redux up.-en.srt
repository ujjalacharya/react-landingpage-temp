1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,460
Write so under section we will bring redux into our project.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,090
OK.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,580
So first I'm going to go to source story and I'm going to create an actions folder and then of course

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,770
we need the reducers.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,700
So I'm going to create reducers.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,670
Now what you could do if you wish.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,170
It's completely up to you.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,370
You can create a different directory called undernote store or redox or something like that and put

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,210
the actions in the reducers in there.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,200
And of course you will need to change the routing.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,840
You can use this in you know in your own fashion.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,440
OK.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,870
So I'm going to leave the directories empty and I'm going to go to index where we need to do all the

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,210
set up for redux.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,920
So first we need to import a lot of things.

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,930
So I'm going to go right here below route and I'm going to say import and the first import that we need

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,340
it's the provider.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:00,330
So space provider now after that provider I'm going to say from and it's from re-act redux.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:06,540
So the provider something that actually connects with redux so we can use it because really redux is

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,890
a third party library.

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,690
So then of course we need to import some things from redux.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,940
So I'm going to say from and then redux.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,750
So what we need to import to use it is to create store create store.

24
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,530
Now we're going to use something more because we will use middleware in our project we cannot actually

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
really work without middleware.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,260
So we need to use the Apply middleware.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,790
All right.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,670
And if you notice I've updated the portion of the code.

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,230
So now it's not great.

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,260
It's kind of you know darker color.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,690
That's good.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,360
You know it's a it's nicer.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,140
OK.

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,660
So if I go to the package that Jasen of the reactor project you can see that we've installed redux promise

35
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,060
and redux tunc.

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,510
So they are of course different but they pretty much do the same thing right.

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,650
We will use promis redux promise and we will not use redux thunk but maybe I'm going to use it much

38
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,720
much later.

39
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,580
But of course I'm going to set this up first.

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:18,420
Now first we need to import them so import import and then it's promise and then middleware just like

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,890
that promise middleware and it's from redux promise.

42
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,700
There we go.

43
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:34,820
Then when Ruddock's thunk so import and then redux and then thunk and it's from redux thunk redux nunc

44
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,680
Vergon.

45
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,760
OK so now of course we need to import the reducers so we can use them right here whenever we create

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,190
the store and we're going to import it of course we don't have a file for that.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,100
You read the reducers just yet.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,140
But I'm going to create it in a couple minutes.

49
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,440
So I'm just going to do the import.

50
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,860
The application will crash because you know we didn't have file for that doesn't exist.

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,910
That's OK.

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,150
So I going to bring the index of reducers.

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,840
All right.

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,540
Now before we can we start setting up everything right here with the provider and everything else you

55
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,810
need to know that I'm going to be using the redux dev tools extension.

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,860
So go to the chrome and just type this and you're going to get it from this developer and right here

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,610
at the bottom.

58
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,000
This is what we're going to be using.

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,130
If I go to the final project and go right here at the top I'm going to get depth tools for redux so

60
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,080
we can see what's happening on that with the state actions and everything else.

61
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,970
So that's really cool.

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,460
So you will need to install it for Chrome.

63
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,070
You have it for Firefox and will excel lecturn.

64
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:46,200
But again you will need to use Chrome or find Firefox and right here you can use it to inside of other

65
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,270
browsers.

66
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,480
Is I'm using Chrome.

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,500
You will need to go to the Chrome Web store and install the extension.

68
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,010
That's the first thing.

69
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,070
Then of course we need to do some setup right here.

70
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,500
You know I know our project to use it right here you have the instructions but don't worry I'm going

71
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
to do it right here.

72
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,270
OK.

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,050
So I'm going to save it and I'm going to say Konst.

74
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:16,710
And what I need to do I need to create a store with middleware so create store with middleware.

75
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,160
Now this is exactly our function.

76
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,760
Our Barville so you can put whatever name you wish right here.

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,580
So what we need to do we need to apply middleware and open and close and right here we need to pass

78
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,720
what are we going to be using for middleware.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,680
And we have this promise middleware that's one thing.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,330
And we have the redux thung so I'm going to put redux thung and at the end we do remind with the create

81
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,920
store.

82
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,860
That's why we were going to do this.

83
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,690
We do this all right.

84
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,000
So now we have this apply we have to create store and we are applying the middleware to the store.

85
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,620
All right.

86
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,970
So the next thing is going to be using the provider we are using right here we have bring in right here

87
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,300
we need to wrap our application inside of the provider.

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,470
So okay I'm going to say provider open and close and I'm going to put the rest of the code inside of

89
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,010
here.

90
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,890
Okay.

91
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,270
So now this provider needs a store.

92
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,680
So I'm going to say store and this one it's going to be equal to the create store with middleware.

93
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,690
So I'm going to put right here now this create the store with middleware meets the reducers in order

94
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,230
to work.

95
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,530
So going to open and close and I'm going to say Okay use that reduce or file.

96
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:41,150
Now if we want to use the tools extension we need to put a coma and pass a second a second argument.

97
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,300
So if I say window nothing happens I don't get an hour to complete.

98
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,440
So if you don't want to type this because we need to do a lot of typing and you want to avoid mistakes

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,150
you can go right here to the documentation and we can copy that's just this line Vesak store windows

100
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,940
redux we tool extension and percent window extension.

101
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
And then just like that.

102
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,080
All right.

103
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,670
So we're going to copy that and then go back to the reducers going to put Coomber and then I'm going

104
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,590
to paste it.

105
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,000
All right.

106
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:18,440
I didn't copy it is TWIGGER all right of course it's a little bit where some going to do the word wrap.

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,190
And just like that we get them we do a search and then the windows dev tools extension and that is it

108
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,940
for now.

109
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm going to save it.

110
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,450
And of course our application not going to really work because we didn't have a valid reducer so we

111
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,690
can go to reducers.

112
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,630
And again add an index that yes.

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,730
OK.

114
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,590
So instead of the index Nagios of the way we do.

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,040
First we need to combined all the available reducers.

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,800
We don't have one but going to create one right now.

117
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:54,020
So first we need to import this combine and then reducers from.

118
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,670
And this one comes from Braddock's OK.

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,940
Now we don't have a valid reducer.

120
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,830
We don't have it.

121
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,020
We're going to create it.

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,840
So we're going to be using users at the beginning so I'm going to create user.

123
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,120
And then from opening close dot for Slash user underscore reducer.

124
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:12,980
OK.

125
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:22,720
Now we need to create a marvel called route reduce her route reduce or with a capital R and then this

126
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,660
one is going to be equal to the combined reducers we're using at the top and it's a it's a method and

127
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,070
we pass an object.

128
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,230
Now what are going to be using We're going to be use inside of the reducer all the available reducers.

129
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,500
Right now we just have one so I'm going to say user I'm going to close it.

130
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,130
Now of course since we are including this file inside of the index yes we need to export it.

131
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,970
So export default and then route reduce or.

132
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,860
Right.

133
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,340
Pretty basic stuff for Rydex.

134
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,340
Now again we didn't have this file.

135
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,860
I'm going to create it right now so inside reducers could it create a new file and it's going to be

136
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,420
user underscore reducer.

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,110
OK.

138
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Now inside of the user reducer what we need to do we will need to return a function that returns a switch

139
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,520
or you know it has a switch inside but returns the state.

140
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:24,440
So export then default default and we need to return a function.

141
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,330
Now this function of course needs two arguments.

142
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,880
First the state with an empty object and then begin to receive an action always in action.

143
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,920
So we passed the action.

144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,040
Now instead of here I'm going to say switch open and close and begin to be checking for the action that

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,670
type.

146
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:48,400
This is pretty basic Rydex configuration is the main set up we need to do for regex.

147
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,360
And of course if we are not finding that type we need to return default with the return state and the

148
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,150
state is going to be equal to whatever state.

149
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,450
OK.

150
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:07,460
So now if we go to our project everything works and we are not getting any errors and warnings.

151
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,450
So we are actually good to go now before we move on to the next section.

152
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm going to go to actions and I am going to create Now I'm going to create a new file.

153
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,410
And for example we are saying that we're going to use user so I'm going to create a file with user actions.

154
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,910
We're not going to do anything just yet.

155
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,040
We're going to do it later.

156
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,200
You're just setting redux right now.

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,810
And we're going to use axioms to make the requests.

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,720
So import Scio's from expose axioms.

159
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,420
Now if you remember whenever we were going to make all the requests and all the actions and everything

160
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,940
else.

161
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,280
So we need to bring the or else now on the server if we go to the server we have different types of

162
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,330
or else API product for product related routes.

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:07,150
And then we have we have we get API end users everything that's related to users so we can have different

164
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,850
action and different actions right here.

165
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,580
User Action product actions.

166
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,730
I don't know side actions so we might have different actions.

167
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,000
And in real life you're going to get a lot of files right here.

168
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,770
This one will get Widick.

169
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:28,240
So and most of the times are going to be making requests to the products you're out if you're working

170
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,300
with products to the user or you're out of your work and your users and everything else.

171
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,380
So what if the Eurail changes you're going to need to go through all your functions and change to your

172
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,430
manually.

173
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,990
So what you can do you can create a viral right here or we can click create a Google Barville with all

174
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,860
the locations.

175
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,060
And that's what I'm going to do.

176
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,130
I'm going to go to resources.

177
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,490
I'm going to go to right here.

179
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,260
Components.

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,070
I believe we didn't have it just yet.

181
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,090
No we didn't.

182
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah I believe we do.

183
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,170
Now we don't want to agree to you till fall or so we don't have you Tilse So we'll get a lot of details.

184
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,940
So inside details I'm going to create a new file called misc.

185
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,600
You know our misc file.

186
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,240
This one will have you know just global general data.

187
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,070
So I'm going to say server then routes just like that.

188
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:27,090
And I'm going to go and export Konst and I say a user server for all the server and could be use or

189
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:36,490
routes or user requests but I'm using server because you know it so that server routes so API for is

190
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,570
for a slash and then users.

191
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,600
I believe that that is correct.

192
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,390
So API end users.

193
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:50,950
All right then we have the export then Konst and we have product server later are we going to be adding

194
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,650
more but for now this is OK.

195
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,860
So we have the API for Slash and we have product.

196
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,640
All right.

197
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,510
So now from within user actions are going to include this file because you know we are going to use

198
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:16,090
this virals so import and from this one that is the user are going to say user server and its from opening

199
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:25,200
close for Slash components for Slash Eutelsat details and then Misc and thats it.

200
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,340
Of course later were going to be using this and we might be adding product server and doing something

201
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,560
else.

202
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,050
But for now all the set up its pretty much complete now.

203
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,510
We are going to use types on this one.

204
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,010
So going to create a type's file just like this.

205
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,030
And I to leave it empty.

206
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,970
Of course we are going to be adding types.

207
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,180
Right now we are not going to do it because we are not going to use redux right.

208
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,060
Right now we can do something else but redux its already ready to go.

209
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,350
If you don't know how to work with types when we reach a section where we need to make a request and

210
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,400
use the redux logic I can explain you explain your why we use types.

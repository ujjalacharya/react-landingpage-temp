1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,540
OK so let's create a Witz model.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,970
We are quick going to be real real simple since we now we know what to do with brands.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,560
We know what to do with books.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,170
So of course in the guitar world you might have a lot of type of words and depending on which one you're

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,780
using on the tar the guitar sounds different.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,420
I know it makes no sense for you maybe for not not a guitar guy.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,230
It says you know it's just wood.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,730
Now it's really important depending on the wood depending on depends the sound.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,490
So OK.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,580
So I'm going to add the round in his closet and inside woods.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,990
We pretty much need to do the same thing.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,020
We need app just like this.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,800
We need a post right.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,660
We need the wrapped.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,640
So it's going to be API for Slash and same product then the brand forward slash and Singler what.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,170
Because we are posting one what then we need our middleware we need the admin middleware.

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,130
And then we run a function.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,000
Right.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,380
And this function contains a request and the response.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,420
Now what we do we need to we need a model.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,250
So we're going to go to model again to create a new one.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:17,090
It's going to be called Wood dodginess are going to bring the requirement Gousse just like this.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,140
Now that would be pretty much need to do the same thing.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:30,000
We need to create a schema so Konst that wood and capital schema then mongoose opening close we create

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,320
a new schema and we pass an object or this once we're just using a name.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,070
Something Real Simple we might use a lot of things.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,560
But for now we're going to do it simple because we are just practicing in real life for example.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,590
This project is going to take us a few few hours.

29
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,980
It's going to take us a few few hours.

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,810
So unique of course just like the Apprentice it's going to take us a few hours and in real life a project

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,710
like this with different guitars and tons of categories.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,690
It's going to take you a month at least at least a month.

33
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,640
So length.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:19,740
So if I tried to save time it's because of one reason you don't want to stay here 20 hours.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,860
So first we create a concept and we need to create what we need to go to mongoose and create the model

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,060
and we passed the capital W word.

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,790
Now one very Come mistake is the capitals right here.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,780
So make sure you use it correctly.

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,510
Then we passed the schema and that's it.

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:52,320
Now we need to make this available so module dot exports and we say would run would not at Brentwood.

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,140
We are not selling booze.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,130
OK.

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,560
So we have the wood available.

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,810
So we need to go here and we need to import it.

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,060
So Konst is going to be equal to wood of course.

46
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,120
So what.

47
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,910
And models for Slash what.

48
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,770
So now we can here's what's so I mean it is going to go right here at the bottom.

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,180
Say Konst we create a word which is going to be equal to a new word.

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,780
And what we do we are going to be passing the request and then the body.

51
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,370
All right.

52
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,200
OK so now I'm going to answer that would that you would.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,410
And I'm going to save it and I'm going to run a function of two ports and if we get we get an error

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,150
and we get a document back.

55
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,370
So if we do get an error.

56
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:53,780
So if error we get a return response that Jaison and we send a success of false and the error just like

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,900
with it before real simple.

58
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,450
And of course if everything goes OK we need to return the wood.

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:09,660
So tell us 200 Jaison opening close and we say success equals to true coma.

60
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,070
And we say what if we send whatever we are storing.

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,240
You know what if we get back from the Mongo am a goose Burguet.

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,270
I always like to do that there's no need to do it here but I like to do it.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,960
OK.

64
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,930
So we are good.

65
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,740
Now let's create the get and then test it on postman says Now we know what to do.

66
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,190
We can actually do it.

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,510
So I'm going to copy the route.

68
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,750
We just need it.

69
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,970
And instead of wood it's going to be what's.

70
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:45,670
And of course we get a function a callback so request then responds we enter the wood model we have

71
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:54,790
right here top and scroll down and we can find everything find everything why we are finding anything.

72
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,160
Everything because of the same we a brand.

73
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,780
The only place where we can even be touching the all the other list of words it's when we enter a new

74
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,520
product.

75
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:12,220
So coma opening close and we're going to say error and then what's OK.

76
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:21,230
So whenever we get back we send an error if we get an error and we return response with a status of

77
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,100
400 or something like that.

78
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,620
And sorry for this I returned a response with a status.

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,550
Four hundred.

80
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,280
And then of course we sent our Roback just like we did before.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,180
If everything goes OK we're going to send the response with a status of two hundred just like this 200

82
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:48,230
and then dot send and we send to what's all right looks nice.

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,450
So I'm going to go to the server and first I'm going to try to you know post something.

84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:02,800
So I'm going to close this once close to brand open new one we will use the U R L and then we go to

85
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,300
what now it's a post.

86
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:15,860
Go to header's concent type enter and then application that Jaison enter Breguet inside body.

87
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,310
We go to Iraq and the only thing we have right here is a name.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,220
And one very common name for words is our other word.

89
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,720
All right.

90
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,400
So let's write a note remember that we are of the educated and we are administrators so we sent and

91
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:43,630
we get true and we get back the other and fight refreshed us we get wood and we get what we get.

92
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,290
So going to store this way it would.

93
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,430
And now let's try to let's try to get it right to get the words so open close.

94
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,200
And now the route it's going to be a little bit different instead of what we get what.

95
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,900
And that is that I sent and we get all the what's.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,510
All right.

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:15,350
We're going to store this and I'm going to say once again what's safe to waves now.

98
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,900
Just like before I give you the the read me file with the Brandt's are going to give you one for what's.

99
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,970
We just have three words.

100
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,220
Now in real life we have at least the most used words.

101
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:36,710
It's like no 20 20 categories 20 different types of what I just added three if you want.

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,820
You could add it manually I can just tell you Basswood for example either is one or mahogany.

103
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,620
You can add this manually.

104
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,220
We're going to do.

105
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm going to give you the read me file with the what's OK.

106
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:57,010
So if I go to once we get this you know Basswood mahogany and other very good I got a copy of this.

107
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,830
To go to robo three.

108
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:06,350
Going to destroy this one just delete document and I'm going to right click insert.

109
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,940
Select everything.

110
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,010
Paste it.

111
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,690
There we go.

112
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,280
We have three different ones.

113
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,140
Burguet Zarka.

114
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,160
Later of course we're going to use it.

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,430
All right.

116
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,870
We are done with words.

117
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm going to give you the zip file of what we have so far on the code.

118
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,140
And then we're going to move forward to the next category which is not a category.

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,770
It's going to be that the actual products that begin to be using that one.

120
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,870
It's going to be a little bit more challenging.

121
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,170
OK.

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,460
So let's go to the next one.

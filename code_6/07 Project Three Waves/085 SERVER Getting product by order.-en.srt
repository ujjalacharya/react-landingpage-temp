1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,080
So we need to bring the articles by a rival you know by a rival and then by cell.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,830
All right.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,910
So pretty much we need to create one single route that can handle this kind of requests.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,000
So first we will get the by arrival.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,710
So I'm going to put it right here.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,780
And then of course you'll have I don't know for Slash articles this is going to be the route articles

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,200
and we need to be passing some quiet drinks.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,870
We're still using coarse drinks.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:37,170
So the first the first attribute is going to be sort by inside of the sore byde a sort by we can to

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:46,230
put what we want to sort out by if we get by a rival if you checked the database what can we use so

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,630
we can get to create it at.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,650
All right.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,610
So this one is going to be created created at.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,350
Right.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,230
Then we need to search to specify the order because this is going to be bringing in is going to break

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,280
the last.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,880
I don't know four of the created at.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,630
So what is going to be the order.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,930
So in this case we can specify in order just like a regular database by descending.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,640
Remember that we could use ascending or descending with databases.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,660
So we're going to specify an order.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,660
And then of course we can do ampersand in any to tell the application how many articles I want to get.

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,890
So in this case we can just limit.

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,050
And in this case we just going to bring 4.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,560
So then the other one is going to be by cell.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,490
So in this one instead of using the created add we need to do something else.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,930
So when we put it right here.

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,630
So we need to still bring articles sorted by and then sold.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,520
If you remember on the database we have the key sold.

30
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,030
So of course is going to order everything by sote.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,470
Now of course we will need to bring it descending and we're going to still bring four.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,520
So this is what we're going to do.

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,030
Now of course we need to create the route and the logic inside.

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,410
Just like with it right here.

35
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,050
So so going to go to app.

36
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,800
It's going to be a get route and again to say API for Slash products and articles.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,430
All right then.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,050
Function opening close and we're still getting a request and a response.

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,970
Right.

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,740
So first we need to bring We need to store inside of our of all the sort by that order and the limit.

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,220
And you can add as many as you want.

42
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,320
Doesn't matter how many atrophies you want.

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,940
So first we begin to set the order the order is going to be equal to whatever we get back from the order.

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,660
Inside right here now sometimes could happen that maybe the order right here it's missing and you can

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,560
have it.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,850
So what I'm going to do I'm going to say OK I went to get the request Querrey that order.

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,190
And if I don't have it I'm going to do something else.

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,710
So if we do have it this one is going to be equal to the same thing.

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,040
But if we don't we don't have it by default is ascending.

50
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,360
All right then to sort by.

51
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:23,730
So let and then sort and then buy equals to request that Querrey Querrey dot and then sort by now if

52
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,970
we do have it then we going to use it.

53
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,130
And if we don't have it by default we search by ID right then we have the limit.

54
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:43,130
So let limit equals request that Kohary that limit if we do have it we can bring the limit.

55
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,370
If not it's going to be by default 100 and make sure that this is a number and not a string.

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,410
All right.

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,870
And and we might have a skip.

58
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,160
I don't know if you use a skip on the database and some database databases.

59
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,110
So sometimes you get to skip.

60
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,650
So would skip pretty much is going to be something like this.

61
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,250
For example we are bringing out no limit.

62
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,380
We are bringing 100 articles so you can add a skip to the request.

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:20,310
And of that hundred 100 if you put five is going to skip the first five and give you ninety five the

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,740
remaining ninety five.

65
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,710
So of course we didn't have this we could do it.

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,080
I'm not going to do it because it's real simple.

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,870
OK so now we need to make that request you know go to the database and bring it.

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,820
So product just like this.

69
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,050
We're going to find.

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,640
And we need to sort a lot of things.

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:49,310
So what we do we populate just like with it before with Brandt remember that we need this brand.

72
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,640
Let me do it just like this popular brand.

73
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,300
Now going to copy the wood right here on the bottom.

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,160
So whenever we get articles we're going to get the brand and the wood.

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,530
All right then we need to sort by.

76
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,730
So I'm going to say sort opening close and right here we need to pass an array and array inside.

77
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,890
So what we do we pass this sort by right here and then we need to we need to order which or we're going

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,190
to be using.

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,550
All right what else are going to do with this going to go at the bottom and we need to specify the limit.

80
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,860
So the limit is going to be whatever we have inside limit.

81
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,100
And then just like we did before we can execute.

82
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,860
And of course we get an error or we get the articles and we run a function.

83
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,860
All right.

84
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:55,880
So if we do get an error if error what we send is a return return and we turn the response with a status

85
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:05,520
of 400 dried Breguet and then send error.

86
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:12,880
So then of course if everything goes OK you can send a response with the articles.

87
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,330
And that is it.

88
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,800
Now once you figure out how this works everything else is just really simple.

89
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,080
So now we are finding a product we are doing a find.

90
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,670
We sort of get the brand and the information we need and we sorted by whatever we are passing right

91
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,370
here.

92
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,100
And then of course we are limiting.

93
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,830
And we are executing.

94
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,040
So this one it's exec.

95
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,850
I always make a mistake right here.

96
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,660
I don't know that we go all right.

97
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,380
So let's try again.

98
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,470
So I'm going to go over here and create a new route and I'm going to copy this.

99
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,610
It's going to be a get.

100
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,590
And of course we need to put the moustache you are l.

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,290
And then of course I'm going to use the first Dubai arrival.

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,460
I'm going to copy this sorry copy and paste it.

103
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,670
So you need to do the questionmark sort by equals to create it at ampersand or their descending ampersand

104
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,670
limit.

105
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,360
For now this is going to fail.

106
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,430
I'm going to tell you why in a second.

107
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,190
Maybe you know why.

108
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,430
All right.

109
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,450
I'm going to dissent and it failed.

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,120
It says Limit field must be numeric.

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:41,350
Whenever we are sending error Balios in you know as a string everything gets converted to a string.

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,700
So this number that you're getting right here.

113
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,460
It's actually a string and limit right here.

114
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,520
Take a number.

115
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,450
So if we don't at limit it means that we don't have it.

116
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,960
I'm going to send it and we get it and we get all the products because by default is going to this number

117
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,870
100.

118
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,500
So very quick fix what we can do.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,470
Parse.

120
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,520
Int.

121
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,440
Opening close

122
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,850
and we save it and I'm going to go back to limit 4.

123
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,950
There you go.

124
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,150
So I'm going to send it and parse it.

125
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,110
Sorry Par's and

126
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,940
look at you know we kind of get it we get the first one.

127
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,820
Let me make this a little bit bigger.

128
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,910
If it's Laramie out maybe not.

129
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:40,780
So we get one we get to get three and we get four Burguet so we get four different articles.

130
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,260
We get Ben.

131
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:51,550
So OK so now we are able to search by date and of course if we checked this this one it's the a c you

132
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,880
700.

133
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,360
So this one should be one of the last products AC.

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
Seven hundred.

135
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,280
So that works OK.

136
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,800
Now Same thing with this the buy sell.

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:12,490
We need to bring this one so I'm going to copy paste and soundbytes sold descending limit and I'm using

138
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,570
Skipp where he uses Gip.

139
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,090
So I'm going to send and we get it.

140
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,580
You know this one sold 38 15 and 15.

141
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,360
We didn't have a lot of sold articles.

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,260
I just hardcoded this information got.

143
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,450
So we were a good man.

144
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:27,900
All right.

145
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,480
So now we can fetch articles by something.

146
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,100
So we are pretty much done with the server.

147
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,850
We have pretty much all the basic things we need.

148
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,040
The basic routes we would need to start creating the the front end.

149
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,790
So I'm going to skip this.

150
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,680
Of course this is going to go to you and you can you know download and you can add things you can do

151
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,650
whatever you want but on the next section we will start creating the client right here and bring in

152
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,430

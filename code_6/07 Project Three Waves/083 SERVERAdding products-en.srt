1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,180
All right so now we're going to be working with products and if you ask yourself what kind of products

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,160
will that guitars.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:13,610
Man if I go to guitars and open the you know the first one new product we get there's another name.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,200
Either way.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,750
So we get the images we get the price the shipping the not available and some specific actions which

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,860
are at the frets.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,560
Maybe they would.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,510
And something else that's good you know very simple.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,080
So now what do we need to do we need to create an endpoint where the administrator can enter new guitars.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,490
Right.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,800
So we're going to do that.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,890
So for this of course we need a model and I'm going to do that first.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,650
I got to go to models and create a new one and I'm going to call this product instead of guitars.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,350
Again you can call this whatever you want.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,870
It's your practice project as well.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,200
So product that jazz.

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,050
Now of course we need to bring a lot of things because we have a lot of things.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,450
So this one is not going to be just like Woods and Brant and Brandt's much more complete.

19
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,890
So what I'm going to copy is the require.

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,720
OK.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,700
OK.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,010
So that is good.

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,560
So I got to go at the bottom and I'm going to say Kunst and product schema just like before.

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,830
Equals to mongoose.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,430
Dodd schema and of course this one takes an object and I'm going to do this and I'm going to you know

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:29,820
close and complete everything we can to create a concept called product with a capital P equals Montagu's

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,050
dot model.

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,610
We create a model based on the schema and this model is going to be called a product with a capital

29
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,680
P.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,570
Right.

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,050
When we pass is the schema right.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,800
Of course we need to export this.

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:53,310
So module that exports equals opening close and we say that we want to send the product very good.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,630
So now we need to do this we need to enter all the fields.

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,890
So each product will have a name saag and to say name open and close required.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,960
Yeah.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,320
Is required then a coma what type of this it's going to be a strength.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,120
So drink comment coma.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,370
It's unique.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,350
Well yes the name is going to be unique because you might have one model of the same guitar.

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,930
You know you can have only one model you have different things.

42
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,930
You know maybe different colors you can attack and most of the times if you go to buy a guitar or something

43
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,510
like that it's like going to a Fender Stratocaster than the model and maybe you have the same model

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,770
but you have a different variation of the color of the type of food maybe.

45
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,280
And they have an additional name.

46
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,150
So OK so unique are going to do max length and max length of 100.

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,860
All right.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,730
An Eminem mistake right here is length.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,310
All right.

50
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,300
So Como we need an inscription.

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,920
So we're going to copy this and go right here at the bottom and this corruption.

52
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,770
So it is still required.

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,310
It's going to be a type of string.

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,780
It's not going to be unique.

55
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,590
And I'm going to add much more you know much more news right here.

56
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,500
You can do right here whatever you want doesn't matter it's up to your your project.

57
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,600
OK.

58
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,250
So then we have a price.

59
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,700
Now if there were a price is still required so require.

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,470
True.

61
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,180
Now the Taieb is going to be a number.

62
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,540
We're going to use a number right here.

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,880
So we say number and we have a max length as well.

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,540
So the max length is going to be 2 5 5 just like you know bar.

65
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:44,720
So we're going to go brand open and close and now this one it's a little bit special because when we

66
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,830
start something on the database what happens if I store the name of the brand.

67
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,650
Let's let's go right here.

68
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm going to store something on a database and say that the name of this one inside rubber Mongo it's

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,100
fender right.

70
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,950
We store this just like with the real name inside of the database.

71
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:08,240
What happens if in the future a Fender change they change the name and now they are Fender or something

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,010
like that.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,240
You will need to go through all your products inside the database and manually changed the name friend

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,880
or friend or and it's not a good idea.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,050
So what we are going to be putting right here inside a brand it's the I.D. of the brand we have on the

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,890
collection of brands which is you know this.

77
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,730
So maybe in the future if they change Fender we can change it from here and it's going to change throughout.

78
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,320
You know he's going to change it in pretty much and the whole application because when we've fetched

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,890
information we fetched the ID and then we make a reference to this name right.

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,630
Pretty standard stuff for for servers and actually databases.

81
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,450
So what do we do.

82
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,460
How can we tell Mungo's that this brand it's up.

83
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,310
It's an object or is an idea is an object idea.

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,770
So I'm going to say type and I'm going to leave it like this.

85
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:08,330
So what we need to do we need to use mongoose that type we talk to access schema then types just like

86
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,530
this types dot and then object ID.

87
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
We get it right there.

88
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,860
Object ID.

89
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,260
And for this we need to bring mongooses Kema right now at the top.

90
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,860
We are bringing Mungo's but not making a reference to the schema.

91
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,550
So we can have you know begin to need to bring it.

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
So when we go right here the top end to the filing.

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:42,310
So I'm going to say Konst schema just like this and we're going to bring it from mongoose Dodd and schema.

94
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,650
Now if I use it just like let me fix this if I use it like this.

95
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,870
Mongooses dot schema dot.

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,130
This is going to work because we are still bringing bingos friends came out fron mongoose.

97
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,470
But now I have a barbel called schema so I can do schema types.

98
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,190
So again the only way with it is just an alias to just a typeless code.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,490
That's good.

100
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,990
Now the next one is a little bit weird to explain.

101
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,950
I'm going to say Raphe and I'm going to say Brandt.

102
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,560
Now we know that the reference of this is going to be the database called Brandee the collection called

103
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,270
Brand.

104
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,060
Right.

105
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,750
OK.

106
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,290
And if you remember if you go to brand we call this like this.

107
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:31,320
So I'm using the exact same name later when we fetch some information from the day from the database

108
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,010
this reference is going to be very handy.

109
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,150
Right now I'm going to add it and you should add it as well.

110
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,320
And we can discuss this later.

111
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,550
So we're going to do a coma and the brand is going to be required.

112
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,910
And all right what is next.

113
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,670
We have shipping.

114
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,690
Of course if you're buying a cheap guitar you don't have any shipping.

115
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,850
But if you buy a very expensive guitar required you do have shipping.

116
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,020
Actually I'm I'm having a problem with that right now.

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:13,400
I'm about to buy a guitar and it's a really expensive guitar and it does when it's and of course boo

118
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,020
Leon.

119
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,120
So it's going to be true or false of course.

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,630
And they and they of course it's a very expensive guitar and they give me no shipping and I'm buying

121
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:31,780
it from a different country so that well I need to call them in and ask them OK.

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,670
So then we we will check if it's available or not.

123
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,070
Sometimes of course if you're buying something it needs to be available for you to buy it.

124
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,860
So we're going to give you an information of the to the user on the react end of things saying that

125
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,730
the guitar is available or not so required and true.

126
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,930
And this one really is going to be just like the other one a boolean.

127
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,010
All right.

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,660
Then we have the wood and the wood.

129
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,310
Same thing then brand.

130
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,560
Same idea.

131
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,490
So I'm going to copy brand I'm going to do koma I'm going to paste it in right here going to say wood

132
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,270
and its schema types object.

133
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,420
But now it's going to be what.

134
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,510
And remember we need to use the same same name that we have a different category called friends.

135
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,060
You know the guitars they have frets.

136
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,460
So this one is going to be required and it's going to be true and it's going to be a type of number

137
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,200
of guitars.

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,620
They have like 20 24 or 22 frets.

139
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,000
So you don't have.

140
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,190
We didn't get a lot of options.

141
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,940
That's why we didn't do a model of this.

142
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,940
So then we need to add something.

143
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:50,160
We need to add the sold what we can to track how many guitars we sell because at home we need to fetch

144
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,770
the best sounding guitars.

145
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,590
So we need to add this.

146
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:03,130
So I'm going to say sold open it close and type of number coma I add a max length.

147
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,930
I don't want to type it.

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,420
I'm going to copy from here.

149
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,120
The max length is going to be 100.

150
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,890
And what we can do if we don't at this is going be a little bit weird.

151
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,640
If we don't add it at the database whenever we search we show something is the default the Isold is

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,180
going to be equal to nothing.

153
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,210
So what we need to do we can set a default saying that whenever we enter a new guitar we sold zero of

154
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,200
this item.

155
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,270
So we can set a default like here that we have publish.

156
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,570
So I'm going to say publish

157
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,340
publish and this one will be required.

158
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:53,820
I get it copy require and that type is going to be Boullion or why we are adding a polish.

159
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,070
Maybe you are entering a new guitar in your database but maybe it's not ready for sale.

160
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,990
You can at least start selling it the next month or something like that so you can put the type required.

161
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,150
I'm sorry they publish false and it will not be displayed on the client.

162
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,780
You know pretty simple.

163
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,610
What else we are going to add we an image just not right now are we're going to do it much later.

164
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,270
So ima just open it close and this type is going to be an array.

165
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,610
Why.

166
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,220
Because we might add different images.

167
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,460
And just like with it before I can add a default the fault of an array an empty array.

168
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,660
Of course if we have an empty array we will displayed.

169
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,190
Is this you know sorry.

170
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Image not available.

171
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,460
If I go to the product sorry image not available.

172
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,930
If we do have images of course we just play the images.

173
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,340
That's why we are doing that default right.

174
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,230
There there's one more thing.

175
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,930
Sometimes when you enter products or you enter things in your database you need to know when this item

176
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,030
was entered in the database and when maybe was updated.

177
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:06,510
For that we need time stamps and what we can do right here instead of creating one value 1 property

178
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,180
for this.

179
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,500
We can say just like this and say Time stamps.

180
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:19,080
Just like this time stamps and true and they will be generated out magically by Mongo when we enter

181
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,780
a new product.

182
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:27,690
So I believe everything is ok either way if I made a mistake we can see it on the console or reflected

183
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,190
on the database.

184
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,660
So let's go to the server and create the route for this.

185
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:38,300
All right so I'm going to create a new section for products so products.

186
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,240
All right.

187
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:46,000
So of course this is going to be post so OP post opening close the location.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,210
It's still API and products just like this.

189
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,600
And since I've already have products I cannot do products I'm going to say article now make sense its

190
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,680
products because we have dumped model.

191
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,390
But you know that's fine.

192
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,170
Of course they need to be authenticated to do this and they need to be administrators to do this.

193
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,630
So at the end we will run the callback function with a request and a response.

194
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,310
Forget Now we need to add a new product.

195
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,120
So we need to import the product right here at the top.

196
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:26,860
So I'm going to say a product with a capital P product and we will require this from models and product.

197
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:37,700
So going to go Kunst product equals to new product and we're going to get the data from the request

198
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,560
and then the body.

199
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,130
Very good.

200
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,430
So of course then when you just we just need to save.

201
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,210
We've done this many times before.

202
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,120
You can try to do it by yourself.

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,910
So I'm going to say product Dodd safe open close.

204
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:57,310
And after we saved everything we will get something back with an error and the actual document.

205
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,210
Now if we get a mistake we're going to catch that error and we're going to return something else.

206
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,830
So Rob responds with Jaison saying that you know dude something is wrong.

207
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,050
So false coma and error.

208
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,780
All right.

209
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,890
Of course if everything goes OK we will send a response with a status of 200.

210
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:26,200
And then we will send some JSM back and we will send its success just like this success.

211
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,990
True.

212
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,040
And I will I want to send the article back so we can see it on the front end.

213
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,850
So article and make a reference to the doc that we get back from mongoose right.

214
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,460
Resample So now we just it's going to copy this.

215
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm going to go to post man.

216
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,280
There is a movie with post man right.

217
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,740
And this is actually forget about this.

218
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,690
This is actually from the all the other product.

219
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,050
It's the same project but it's the one that it's done.

220
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,620
I was just inspecting.

221
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,750
So I'm going to open a new one.

222
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,220
And we are now on Waites.

223
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,410
So it's going to be a post open and close.

224
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,720
We use the euro.

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,960
We do have a cookie and I believe this cookies ok you know the token it's OK.

226
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:21,380
So API product an article when it said headers of content type you know usual stif usual stuff Content-Type

227
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,240
an application.

228
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,110
Jason got the body wrong.

229
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,120
And Jason so right now we need to do a lot of things because we have a lot of fields.

230
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,850
So open close.

231
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,310
First we need a name.

232
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,150
And of course if you don't know about guitars I'm going to give you the name of my guitar.

233
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:53,300
I'm very proud of this proud proud 2 2 4 2 2 2 0 4 I forgot 2 4 0 2 0 2 4 0 2 wonderful guitar very

234
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,060
jazzy.

235
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,530
So the name is that is the name of the guitar not the brand.

236
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,940
The brand is different than coma.

237
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:12,930
We need a description so this corruption me it correctly description and description super awesome guitar.

238
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:19,220
In real life you will get a lot of you know a pretty large string because the description now you know

239
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,250
there's no need.

240
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,480
Now we need to price the price.

241
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,070
It's going to be two thousand and this is the real price.

242
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,130
So yeah a lot of money but I do a lot of playing That's why I paid.

243
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,040
So let me get to brand.

244
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,890
I cannot say Ivan.

245
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,860
I can not do that.

246
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,410
Because remember that we are storing the ID of this on the database.

247
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,760
So what I need to do I need to pass the ID of I have an s.

248
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:53,780
So if I go to robo 3 t and i go to France I tried to find one is one and it's this one I'm going to

249
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:02,600
select an edit document and I'm going to copy the ID and then I go back there is it next to the brand.

250
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,760
Note the shipping.

251
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,440
So we say shipping is going to be equal to true.

252
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:19,820
Then we say it will check if it's available VEI level and it's going to be equal to true this in real

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,410
life.

254
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,200
It's not true.

255
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,970
They never have it available because it is an expensive guitar.

256
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,180
So that what.

257
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,610
And of course need to do the same thing with this and if you're asking yourself why are you buying expensive

258
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,080
guitars.

259
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,320
Do you have a lot of money.

260
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
No I don't.

261
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,220
I'm am addicted.

262
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,960
So I spent money that I don't have.

263
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,070
So I'm going to click on this.

264
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,170
This one is OK.

265
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,430
So the word the idea for the wood is going to be this.

266
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,470
Then of course we need Fretz.

267
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,270
And again this one has 24 frets coma and then and it's the last one we need to select.

268
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,170
We need to put the Publish the publish is going to be true.

269
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,860
All right man.

270
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,970
Everything is good.

271
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,650
So this is this should be it.

272
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,090
We shouldn't be getting any palms of course we might get a little problem a tiny problem because we

273
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,300
did a lot of coding and I'm human.

274
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,080
All right.

275
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,900
So we have everything just going to send that and see what happens.

276
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,700
And I couldn't get a response.

277
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,970
And we're going to check the server.

278
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,830
I'm pretty sure we get them stick right here.

279
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,060
So module export that product.

280
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,660
It's mondial.

281
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,280
That's a new one.

282
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,320
So let's go to product and module exports.

283
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,010
All right let's try again.

284
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,650
I told you I'm human.

285
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,190
All right.

286
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,550
Simple mistake.

287
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,390
So we get a response back with success.

288
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:51,960
True.

289
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,520
And all the information about that article.

290
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,170
Right.

291
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,570
Very good.

292
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,730
Man going to open and refresh tapes go to products and it's good.

293
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
And notice that we are creating the getting the created ad in the updated.

294
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,020
And this one will it will come handy later and everything else is default images.

295
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,720
It's an array so everything is good.

296
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,140
And notice that now inside the brand we don't have just the ID between coats.

297
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,170
We get the key word object id just like the idea of this of this element.

298
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,150
Right.

299
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:34,890
So Mongo is doing this for us because later we're going to be referring to this brand and this would

300
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,270
as an object ID.

301
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,720
We really need this.

302
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,540
OK.

303
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,950
So everything is good.

304
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,590
I'm going to go right here.

305
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:50,790
I'm going to save this and this one is going to be products or could be article actually article save

306
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:58,240
two weights and now of course we need a lot of a lot of products right here to do the next route.

307
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,040
Going to be fetching the products are many products.

308
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,510
So just like before I'm going to put inside Jason the products and you will need to import it and going

309
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,840
to do it with you right now.

310
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,640
OK so I got the products and you know a lot of products are I mean.

311
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,870
So I'm going to copy all and go to robo 3.

312
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,160
T going to delete the one I have and delete it.

313
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,610
And then of course insert and select and paste all make sure you don't have any spaces at the top and

314
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,160
at the bottom at the end it was like this.

315
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,710
I'm going to save it.

316
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,270
And there we go.

317
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,220
Now whenever you add some information and you pay something you can just validate and rehab.

318
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,390
Jason is valid.

319
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,980
So you can do that.

320
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,860
All right so we have a lot of products right now.

321
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,540
So we need it.

322
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,590
Let's go to the next section and on the next section we're going to be fetching the products.

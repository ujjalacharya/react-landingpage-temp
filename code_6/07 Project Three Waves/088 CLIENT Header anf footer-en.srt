1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,750
OK so inside source resources.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,240
Yes.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,430
And the style and the images.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,200
Now one more thing and again I'm going to tell you don't take a reference for this course.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,830
At least this is styles that see assess I make this made this really really really superfast.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,480
Why.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,140
Because of course again I didn't want to spend a lot of time doing the SS now.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,800
When you create a Web site the real CSSA has to be neat.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,750
And I wouldn't use just CSSA when you SAS or less or something like that media compiler but not just

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,500
this.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,870
Now if you look at it you can check it out.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,830
It's a mess right.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,540
I did this really really fast.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,690
Don't take this CSSA as a reference for real life right now.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,390
Again if you ask me how much time took me to build this.

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,800
Everything like three days maybe four.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,050
With the design.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,620
And it's because of course it didn't spend a lot of time do it.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,970
SS Now when I build the most was the times when I build things I'd spend a lot of time doing Yesus a

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,390
lot of time because of course this is a mess and you could move forward on the application.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,420
Everything is going to be a mess.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,430
So it's always good to have a good C Ss so don't take this one as a reference.

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,200
OK.

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,200
So of course and on the application we're going to focus on re-act pretty much and Javascript.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,980
We're going to be using routes.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,550
Right.

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,130
OK.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:37,260
So first I'm going to go and inport the CSX import data for Slash resources for Slash CSSA for Slash

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,250
styles.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,130
Right.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,150
We don't have an app I want to get it routes so I renamed the routes the app to routes that get that

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,300
G-S right.

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,700
OK.

34
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,470
Then of course we going to change some things.

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:58,570
So instead of the index we are not importing it up we are importing routes then go back and bring out

36
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,870
routes Burguet.

37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,010
So instead of routes we need to wrap routes with browser router right.

38
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,470
We are going to reuse routes so we need the browser router browser and then router.

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,300
OK.

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,750
It's going to be from re-act router.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,560
Dom Burguet So we need to wrap the application with re-act browser Dom.

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,570
Now again we changed the name from app to routes so going to say routes and that is that for now they

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,720
are.

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,040
This is going to change because we need to bring redux right here.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,830
The make some space.

46
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,660
So now routes it's not up any more.

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,280
Right.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,290
So we need to change all of this right here.

49
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,470
So I'm going to go to app and now let me delete everything and I'm going into that component.

50
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,730
So it's just going to be statelets component.

51
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:05,790
So Konst then routes it's going to be equal to just a function and the function will return something.

52
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,940
Now when will we turn around and the switch.

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,090
So we need to bring switch and route from a re-act Rotterdam.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:27,100
So import we bring switch just like this coma and route and it's going to be from re-act router.

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,260
Dom very good.

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,480
All right.

57
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:40,570
So right now we are just waiting to export of course there we go as white it was great out.

58
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,880
I don't know why and this one it's a mistake.

59
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,240
We just react from react.

60
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,620
It's a mistake from the virus code.

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,440
Now we need to return something where we going to be returning.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,480
It's going to be a switch.

63
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:51,920
Right.

64
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,810
So switch opening close can it did this many many times.

65
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,700
Now we need to render a route.

66
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,210
We need to return a route.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,420
We don't have any of that.

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,630
So I'm going to create one single round round.

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,860
And right now it's going to be components and inside components are going to create the home route.

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,020
That's the main route.

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,080
So home and this home is going to be in the works that Julius index is.

72
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:26,700
All right so of course right now home is going to be a class then of course we can extend this.

73
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,470
So re-act class based component and this one calls home.

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,570
All right.

75
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,520
Like E.T. then home.

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,710
OK.

77
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,370
So now I'm going to go back to routes and I need to import the route.

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:56,590
So import port home capital H home from full force slash components and then home since it's an index

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,020
we don't need to bring it up.

80
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,840
So I'm going to bring gert just like this.

81
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,910
We do need a path and the path is going to be for us.

82
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,300
We need exact.

83
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,500
And then we need to specify which components we are going to be rendering and what happened.

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,230
Component equals and then equals whole.

85
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,720
All right.

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,730
Very simple stuff.

87
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,580
Okay.

88
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,430
So of course if we go we get home that is good.

89
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,810
Now we need to render a header and then a footer.

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,320
So like we did before we can create a layout for this right just like with the before pretty much same

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,120
idea.

92
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:41,730
So inside source I'm going to create a new directory called HBC for height or their components or you

93
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,050
can put it inside components.

94
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,860
This is completely up to you.

95
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,410
Now we need to create the layout hato see.

96
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,760
So layout that.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,060
Yes.

98
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,610
So this layout will be rendering the header whenever we need to get in the middle right here which is

99
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,630
home in this case.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,900
And then the footer.

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,850
So I need to create a class based component re-act class based component.

102
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,150
And later we're going to be extending this layout.

103
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,570
That's why I why I'm creating a class.

104
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:19,590
So I'm going to change the name to lay out with a capital L default layout.

105
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,570
So right now we are just going to render a container.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,780
So this class name and then page container.

107
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,370
And inside we will be rendering this that prompts the children.

108
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,480
So I know this is going to boring because we did this already so it's all the usual setup of course

109
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,700
nothing happens because we need to import inside routes and wrap everything with layout.

110
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:57,650
So import layout from that for Slash HSC and then lay out a graph layout and wrap everything inside.

111
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,510
I get the bloats and you know we get this letter.

112
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,190
And then at the bottom we get nothing.

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,650
So I'm going to go to lay out and in this case right here we're going to create a component for the

114
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,940
header and we can create a component for the footer.

115
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,720
So if the up readouts I mean get the header and footer.

116
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,450
So that works.

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,230
So now we don't we don't have headers.

118
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:29,340
So I'm going to go to component's create a new directory for this and I'm going to call it Hetter underscore

119
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,070
footer so you can choose whatever name in that footer.

120
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,320
Inside what we will get of course is the header and footer.

121
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,610
So going to add a directory for each.

122
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,290
So I'm going to say Hetter just like this header.

123
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,640
And then we will get a footer.

124
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,540
So I'm going to say footer.

125
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,730
OK.

126
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,720
So inside of the header We just have one file.

127
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,040
We could have many files.

128
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,490
It's completely up to you indexed.

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,330
Yes.

130
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,610
Now the header right now is going to do something really really simple but it's going to be a class

131
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,310
based component later.

132
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,360
You can extend this so react class based components.

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:19,330
This one is going to be called Hetter so Hetter open and close and hetter open it close.

134
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,850
Now for now we are just going to return some you know some template.

135
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:30,720
So we're going to say we're going to wrap everything into the head or tack just like this and we copy

136
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,020
and make it right.

137
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,590
All right.

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,210
So we're going to add a class name to the main header.

139
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,240
So class name and it's going to be b c k.

140
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:45,930
You know for the background B and then light all right then we're going to have a div with the class

141
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:54,860
name of container and this is a main class and then if you check the original define one we have all

142
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,530
kind of a left and right.

143
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,240
So we're going to create a div for left and a div for the right.

144
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,460
Very simple stuff.

145
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:12,030
So class name is would be much easier for me to use bootstrap But again just using a long line of class

146
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,440
names I don't like this.

147
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,590
Right now it's a lot of typing.

148
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,640
It's better but a lot of typing.

149
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,980
So instead of here instead of the left we will have a logo which is the name of the Web site.

150
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,450
And for this one will have Wake's.

151
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,910
Now on the right side going to say class name and I'm going to say right Hoopes right and the right

152
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,880
side we will get the top links and the bottom links.

153
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:45,010
So this one will have a class name of top just like this.

154
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,940
And the other one will have a class name.

155
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,790
Bottom right make sense just the opposite of this.

156
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,940
So bottom and I'm going to put you know something like links links and links.

157
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,640
We're going to do this later why we're going to see why later.

158
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,500
Don't worry.

159
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,960
So we sort of we have kind of a header so we need to import inside the layout.

160
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,690
Right.

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:23,880
So import import import header from DOD forward slash come down for Slash components for Slash head

162
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,490
or footer for Slash than hetero's we have an index that's it.

163
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,420
So I'm going to make a reference to the letter and that is it.

164
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,710
All right.

165
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,380
So let's go to our obligation and we get it ugly but we get it so we get Hetter and everything else.

166
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:38,960
All right.

167
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,440
So let's do the footer right now.

168
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,760
We're going to go here and inside of the footer.

169
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,410
I'm going to create a new X that ass.

170
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,430
And of course the footer could be a classmate's component.

171
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:58,400
But I'm going to make it up re-act stateless component Oh sorry stateless.

172
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,530
All right.

173
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,180
So this one is going to be footer.

174
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,300
And I know that this footer looks simple right here but we need to do a lot of stuff because we use

175
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,900
icons.

176
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,830
So before we do that I'm going to bring the icons if you remember whenever we installed everything we've

177
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,910
installed.

178
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,370
Fonte awesome right.

179
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,960
So I got to go right here and I'm going to start importing.

180
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,060
Awesome so I'm going to say import then font just like this.

181
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:32,930
Awesome and that icon and from opening close we need to use the at font.

182
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,510
Awesome re-act font.

183
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,410
Awesome.

184
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,560
Actually this is my mistake it's re-act phantasm.

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,970
Very good.

186
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,700
Now I'm going to close it and I'm going to go at the bottom.

187
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,860
So we need four different icons.

188
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,900
We need the this one this one and this one and this one right.

189
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,700
So if you want to use it we need to import it.

190
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,310
So the name of this it's f a.

191
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,120
And I'm going to bring the Compaq's.

192
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,040
So that is for the location.

193
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:07,120
So from opening close and we need to import it from and to band that it's not Imedi out to complete

194
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,310
them.

195
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,990
See if I can get it right.

196
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,190
Not really because it's a pretty long string.

197
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,130
So let me see if I can find it.

198
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,110
If not begin any to type it.

199
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,180
So it's going to be fun.

200
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,750
Awesome.

201
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,760
And yeah I got it.

202
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,200
Font awesome awesome and freeze solid.

203
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,580
We are using the free package of phantasm.

204
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,730
So if you want to use a professional.

205
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,610
Of course you need to pay that.

206
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,970
Everything is free.

207
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,510
So we have the face of a compass.

208
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,190
I get a copy of this because I don't want to type it again.

209
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,990
And the next one is going to be the phone.

210
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,760
So it's F A and then phone just like this.

211
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,050
Same thing here.

212
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,960
Get a copy of this one pasted the next one is Clark.

213
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,390
So Clark I know this is boring but we're almost not going to copy this one.

214
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,140
And the next one is going to be envelope.

215
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,420
So envelope

216
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,140
All right below target we are done.

217
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,340
Now I'm going to go right here the bottom and we need to start creating this.

218
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:20,450
So everything is going to be wrapped inside of the footer just like this food or so inside of food.

219
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,890
We will add a class could skip the class.

220
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:31,420
But the thing is that the filter has a kind of a background so b c k underscore B underscore dark.

221
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
All right.

222
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,880
Now we need to wrap the inside inside of a container so class name and then we have container.

223
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,970
All right then in the we have a logo.

224
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,790
If you check the origin one of the top we have the waves and then the line.

225
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,620
So we need to create a new def and inside of the def we're going to say waves.

226
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,930
And the class name of course it's logo.

227
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,010
Real simple.

228
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,500
So after this we have a wrapper.

229
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,950
So Def open it close and a class name of wrapper.

230
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,570
All right.

231
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,010
So I'm going to go right here and we have two different places.

232
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,890
We have the left side and the right side of the wrapper.

233
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,460
OK.

234
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,820
So inside of the wrapper I will add a div with a class name just then with a class name of left because

235
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:30,590
we have two sides and and the other side I made a mistake and actually named it equally and same because

236
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,680
it's actually using the same property so I didn't change it.

237
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,650
So in real life again you should do a different thing.

238
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,930
Don't take the.

239
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,920
This s.c.s CSSA as a reference.

240
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,120
So in the left in the new Dewani on the left not the class you know the box in the left will have the

241
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,910
contact information.

242
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,300
So I'm just going to go create an H2 and say contact information.

243
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,850
Now each side will have some tax.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,390
So the wrapper for this one its class name and then business info this this and that info it was taken

245
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,730
there.

246
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,000
But that's fine that it's the actual name of the class.

247
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,470
Now out of here we will have tax.

248
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:18,020
So I'm going to create a class name with attack and later we're going to be copying and pasting to create

249
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,690
the rest.

250
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,630
So we don't need to type all the way.

251
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,030
So right here we need to add the font awesome icon so font.

252
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,620
Awesome.

253
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,730
I can open and close.

254
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,460
So this one takes the icon as a reference which I can we want to display and since we are importing

255
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,760
here at the top we can say I can and that's it.

256
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,810
We're going to adding an additional class name of icon.

257
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,400
And then after the icon we create a new div with a class name of.

258
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,640
Now inside we do have we need to put the values address working hours phone and email.

259
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,970
Now later this information will come from the server.

260
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,050
Of course we didn't create a place where we can store that that we begin to do it.

261
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,230
At the end because it's not that important right now.

262
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,040
OK.

263
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:14,430
So Dave drew Yes and then we put the address so you address.

264
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:14,780
I don't know.

265
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,430
Kramer.

266
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,650
One two three four or whatever.

267
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,490
Doesn't matter.

268
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,560
OK.

269
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,590
So if I save this and I go we get nothing of course because we need to include it.

270
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:37,330
So I go to lay out import then footer from the dot for Slash components for Slash header footer and

271
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,110
then we just bring footer.

272
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,990
All right.

273
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,680
Of course we need to make a reference to this

274
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,780
there we go.

275
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,800
And we get a footer and we get the they the tag.

276
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,570
So let's do the other tasks real real fast.

277
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,980
So we're going to go creek.

278
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,020
Copy the tack go at the bottom paste attack.

279
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,860
And this one instead of compass.

280
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,650
Is going to be fun with a capital P just like this.

281
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,130
And of course the name it's different.

282
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,140
We get phone

283
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,040
phone and I don't know whatever doesn't matter.

284
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,130
The very simple phone then we have a new tag.

285
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,780
And the next time the next task is going to be the clock this one and they copy the name put clock and

286
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:39,720
this one will be equal to working hours so working hours and again right here you can put whatever you

287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,980
want to put.

288
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:50,160
Monday and Sunday till 9 until 8 p.m. you know business hours and the next one is going to be the envelope

289
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,910
which is the e-mail address.

290
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,080
So I'm going to go right here and select a envelope and this one is going to be e-mail.

291
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,780
You're almost done on more than I know.

292
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:07,330
I know this hurts but we need to finish and info and then wave stuff com doesn't matter.

293
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,610
We might change this later.

294
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,990
So if I save it and check it we get pretty much everything that is good now in the right we can get.

295
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,580
We're going to get something different.

296
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,210
Be the first to know.

297
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,640
So I'm going to go right here inside of the on the left and I'm going to say to be the first to know.

298
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:31,530
And then we get a dev with some div inside could be a paragraph or something like that like that doesn't

299
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,110
matter.

300
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,590
I'm going to copy right here.

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,300
TEXT I have to find one you can type whatever you want doesn't matter.

302
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,850
All right.

303
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,490
Let's check our project.

304
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,110
Very good.

305
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,170
So everything works.

306
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,820
We have had header and footer and then we have a home component that will be doing that on the next

307
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,630
section.

308
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,120
Now all of this later we're going to fetch this from the server and right here and I'm going to add

309
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,900
this one as a bonus we can begin to create a place where we can at the user e-mail that Nippert and

310
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,860
the user can enter the email and we will be adding ourselves to the e-mailing list to the mail list.

311
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,470
Right.

312
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,290
OK.

313
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,520
So far so good.

314
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,930
I'm going to sip the code until this point.

315
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,580
And you can download and you can start working with this particular code if you wish.

316
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,400
OK so let's go to the next one.

1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,780
OK so let's keep going with this.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,090
Of course now we have the we have the ability to log in.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,730
So now we need to register new customers.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,130
So if I go to create an account we're going to go to the register route.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,080
We don't have this route.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,340
So we need to create it.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,690
So I'm going to go to register or log in I'm going to create a new file and call register ride that

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,060
yes of course we need to add this route to routes.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:36,910
So I'm going to go two routes and of course import register from and then opening close.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:45,100
We're going to get components for Slash and register Lagann no register sorry for that for Slash or

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,210
just log in sorry and then register again.

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,540
Right.

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,300
So now of course we need to include the route.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,680
So I'm going to copy this one I'm going to pace that down here at the bottom.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,380
And of course the route will be just register.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,940
OK.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,570
So paste you know the usual stuff.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,960
So register.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,520
OK.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,760
So now of course if we go to register I'm going to close it close everything else because you can and

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,150
of course use some of this but not right now.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,590
I'm going to leave the log in open because a lot of things will be the same.

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,280
And instead of typing everything again I'm just going to copy from here.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,980
I'm going to go to the register and this one.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,020
It's going to be a re-act class based component.

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,220
So opening close going to change the capital are to register.

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,830
And if I do register right here and reload the application we should be getting register Burguet.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,190
OK.

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,140
So we're kind of a good to go.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,140
So just like we did with the log in we will need a few things from here.

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,730
So I'm going to import the form fields just like with the log in going to copy this just form fill we

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,810
will need the update to generate data and is formatted from auctions.

33
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,570
So I'm going to copy this to first first copy paste.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,860
Now we will use connect.

35
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:12,190
So to port connect and of course then we will need to import something from user actions just like this.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,410
So for now I'm just going to copy paste this one we're going to delete this one because we don't need

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,010
this one.

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,710
Now I'm going to leave it now.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,850
Just like the Lagann at the bottom.

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,680
We are doing the can connect.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,300
And since this route will be you know like the main component inside routes we didn't need to bring

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,660
with router so it is going to go to register what happened.

43
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,920
There we go.

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,230
Let me just close this right.

45
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,090
Doesn't matter.

46
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,210
So I have a cable right here which is a cable of the microphone.

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,270
And you know it's in the middle of the mouse.

48
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:50,810
OK.

49
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,210
So I'm going to copy and just put the register right here.

50
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,000
OK.

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,620
So now we have pretty much all the things we need.

52
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,620
We have redux.

53
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,630
We have the form fields and everything else just like we did with the log in we need to state with all

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,200
of this.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,390
So I'm going to go right here at the top and create a state of equal to something.

56
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,690
So we need form error and we need to form data.

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,040
So for now just going to copy and do this.

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,810
All right.

59
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,810
Now if I go to the final one and I go to this one and we go to the register we have this tiny box with

60
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,200
a name last name email and then we need to confirm password I'm sorry password and confirm confirm password.

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,880
So we need to create different fields for this one.

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,710
So first it's going to be the name I'm going to copy this one going to copy the mail that we have inside

63
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,170
log in and I'm going to paste it in of course changed values.

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,790
So this one will be name and the input still an input instead of email is going to be name.

65
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,460
Same thing right here.

66
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:55,990
All right.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,910
So enter your name.

68
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,550
All right.

69
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,490
So validation we need to remove the e-mail and it's just going to be required.

70
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,460
Valid false touch false and validation message.

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,370
All right so everything it's just like we need to be then I get a copy of this one I'm going to paste

72
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,250
it at the bottom.

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,390
And this one will be last name.

74
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,580
And then of course I will change all of your other inputs.

75
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,080
Last name.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,660
Input type of actually name actually here.

77
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,530
The type should be text.

78
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,590
Sorry for this text.

79
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,010
And there's one text as well.

80
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,620
And then enter your last name still required and everything else.

81
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,990
Then we have the email going to save it.

82
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,240
And again the e-mails same configuration so I'm going to copy the one from the log in and they're going

83
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,030
to paste it down here.

84
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,200
Then we need a passport to go to log and copy the passport and paste it because it's going to be the

85
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,490
same code.

86
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,070
So paste.

87
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,930
Very good.

88
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,570
Now when we the last field is going to be the confirmed password and this one is going to be a little

89
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,270
bit a little bit weird because whenever we send this to the database to the server we just need to add

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,200
a new user with this name last name email and one password.

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,570
So this one will not pass.

92
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,790
This one is just for validation.

93
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:19,430
So when we need to do is we need to create a field and then when we send everything to the server we're

94
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,550
going to remove that field.

95
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:29,070
Now this confirmed passport needs to match or try to match whatever we have inside passport.

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:36,920
So going to go I'm going to copy the passport and say confirm and then with a capital P passport still

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,200
going to be any input it's going to be a password input going to say confirm.

98
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:50,080
Confirm underscore equal to you know again type passport and then on this one confirm your passport

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,360
all right now the validation is what it's going to be weird because it's still required.

100
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,950
But we need to add a new rule.

101
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,660
We need to tell the validation that this field needs to be equal to this one.

102
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,200
All right.

103
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:12,750
So I'm going to go right here and say coma and then confirm and then passport you're going to say this.

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,380
So by doing this whenever we reach validation and we will need to added Of course you're going to say

105
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:24,000
OK this field that begin to be band aiding the value of this one needs to be exactly the same password

106
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,620
is the same as passport.

107
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,040
Is this field.

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,850
This is why I'm making reference to password.

109
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,880
So then when we reached a validation we're going to check ok with it what is the value for this one

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,420
and what is the value for the other one we have the top they match.

111
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:37,860
No.

112
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,400
Yes.

113
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,490
What are we going to do.

114
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,170
So that's the the main idea of this.

115
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,870
Now of course we need to start creating all of this.

116
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,840
So I'm going to delete this.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,150
I'm going to go to class name opening close and Page underscore wrapper.

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,130
All right then we have a container so I'm going to add a container.

119
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,780
There we go.

120
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,860
Dev of class container.

121
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,630
All right container.

122
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,370
What else.

123
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,990
Right here.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Going to create a new wrapper div opening close and this div are going to add a class name of register

125
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,570
underscore in underscore container.

126
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,460
All right.

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:32,470
Now if we check what we get right here on the final one we have kind of again a left side and an M a

128
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,850
downside Ryan on a bright side.

129
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,520
OK.

130
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,140
So it could be a left side or it could be just one div.

131
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,440
Does it matter.

132
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,290
I'll come up with the following.

133
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,350
Because I'm out in the class and maybe I did this in a different way just like this.

134
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,200
And then I change it back and I forgot to change the name of the class because right now it makes no

135
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,860
sense because I going to say class name again.

136
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm going to put the left.

137
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,440
This is proved very much because they've made a mistake when I was creating this.

138
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,680
But doesn't matter.

139
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,700
Just one tip.

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,460
All right.

141
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,390
So I'm going to create a form.

142
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:12,630
Open and close and just like with it before this form will get an on sieve met.

143
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,090
All right open and close and just like with that before we need to be passing the function that we're

144
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,360
going to be doing with the actual event.

145
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,840
All right.

146
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,660
And then this that serve mid form opening close and we pass that event.

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,130
So I'm going to say some form opening close and we just you know do a function.

148
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,220
OK.

149
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,930
So now at the top we have a title.

150
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,760
So I'm going to add an H to tack which is says personal information.

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
All right.

152
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,620
Now we have two blocks.

153
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,330
The one at the top and the one at the bottom.

154
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,350
So I'm going to wrap the first block inside of a div just like here.

155
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,360
Let me do it like this.

156
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,520
OK.

157
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,510
So I'm going to say div and there's declasse Oh sorry.

158
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:15,000
The class name I gave to this container which is going to be a form underscore block and then to that

159
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,750
some of the clauses make no sense but that's OK.

160
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,060
Then Dave and I are going to add a class name again of Block.

161
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,480
All right.

162
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,330
And this is what we care we need to add the form field right here.

163
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,020
Now of course we have two blocks which is this one.

164
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,280
And it's this one.

165
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,810
So the first one we need to add the form filled.

166
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm going to copy the one we have right here which is the one for name and then the one for last name.

167
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,450
So I'm going to paste it and this one will be name and this one as well.

168
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,230
All right.

169
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,870
So in theory at least we should be getting something just going to keep going forward.

170
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm going to copy with the block with the div and class block.

171
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,930
And then going to paste it down here at the bottom.

172
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,430
And this one will be last name.

173
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,320
So last name.

174
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,540
Copy paste.

175
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,150
All right let's see what we get.

176
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,150
And I got a can I get it.

177
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:17,640
Then we have a different feel which is going to be a complete block a width of 100 percent kind of thing.

178
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,580
So this one is going to go outside of the form block.

179
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,790
Just going to be a div.

180
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,390
So outside of the form block two are going to create a div.

181
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,850
Open and close and this one will be an e-mail and I'm going to just copy the one we have right here

182
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,060
from Lagann and paste it real simple.

183
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,280
OK.

184
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,550
Let's see what to get.

185
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,850
And there we go OK let's get now we have the accounting formation.

186
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,600
So it's pretty much just like the form block too.

187
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,130
It's pretty much the same thing.

188
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,190
So just outside of the email field I'm going to create an age to tack.

189
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,970
And there's one account could be instead of account information.

190
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,150
Oh and I will remember because of the personal information I was getting at the field for last name

191
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,910
e-mail and everything else in a county formation is going to be the address the phone and that kind

192
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,660
of things.

193
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,140
But we're going to do that after we are logged in we're going to do that later.

194
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,260
Maybe I didn't just I didn't change this.

195
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,460
Forgot to change it.

196
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,700
So this one should be verified passport

197
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,810
very fine passport.

198
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,930
Kind of makes sense.

199
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,080
And on this one just like before going to copy the tag.

200
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,700
It's a form block too.

201
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,400
All right.

202
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,650
They're opening close.

203
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,400
And again we will have two different blocks so I'm going to copy this ones from here and I'm going to

204
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,730
paste them right here.

205
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,990
All right.

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,790
So now this form field instead of name is going to be password.

207
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,860
This one passport.

208
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:02,200
And remember that we have a confirmed passport so confirm passport and confirm passport on the.

209
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,690
On the other one.

210
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,990
Very good.

211
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,100
OK.

212
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,910
So we are kind of not going to go but we are much much closer.

213
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,700
So I'm going to go back and check how this goes.

214
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,980
So Burguet we have everything we need.

215
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,150
Of course if I type something the application fails.

216
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,990
Right.

217
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,840
So we need to add the update form function.

218
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,560
So we're going to go right here at the top and say update form.

219
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,720
Just like we did before date form.

220
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,290
Now this time is going to be much much easier.

221
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,860
Why is going to be much easier.

222
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,540
Because we've already have all the functions and the helpers that we created on the privy section.

223
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,960
General data this for Balad and the update form.

224
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,820
So now the update form is going to be pretty much the same on this one.

225
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,120
We just use the same thing.

226
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,040
The only thing we change is the keyboard of what we are actually doing.

227
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,450
So I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go to update form and paste it.

228
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,070
All right let's try again.

229
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,640
So I'm going to type something.

230
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,470
And now it updates.

231
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,270
All right very good.

232
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,770
So that is get now on the submit form.

233
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,540
We need to do pretty much the same thing.

234
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:15,290
And now right here are going to say this one is register going to go back to log in copy what we have

235
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,420
from submit form.

236
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,700
Let me make this Nizer copy what we get from submit form.

237
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,490
I can paste it right here.

238
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,400
And of course everything else is going to be the same.

239
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,250
The only thing we're going to change is the keyword keyword.

240
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,120
And inside of the form ballot.

241
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,790
The only thing we can output right now it's a console log for the data to submit just so we can make

242
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,840
sure that everything is going as planned.

243
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,400
All right.

244
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,930
So you know pretty much pretty much ready.

245
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,900
So OK.

246
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,250
I'm going to be adding some.

247
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,890
The button the buttons at the bottom because we didn't have them.

248
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:56,060
So let's go right here at the bottom and right here we have the last block which is the close of the

249
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,910
last block.

250
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,650
We have the div and then we have the form.

251
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,930
So what I'm going to do is before the close of the form I'm going to add the buttons.

252
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,410
So I'm going to go right here for you to decide.

253
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,930
We are almost done now on this one.

254
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,430
We need to pretty much do the same thing than before.

255
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,110
Again we're going to go to the log in and I'm going to copy this.

256
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm going to go right here and paste it and make it a little bit nicer.

257
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,680
All right man.

258
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,590
So please check your data.

259
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,280
If we do get an error could be something went wrong.

260
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,170
Try again.

261
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,100
Does it matter.

262
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,530
And then of course instead of log in is going to be create an account.

263
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,140
All right.

264
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,280
Everything is the same.

265
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,780
So right there we go.

266
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,350
So now what we need to do and what we're going to be doing is to of course submit the form.

267
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,630
Make sure that everything is OK and we need to fix this.

268
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,960
You know we add this rule to the validation to confirm password thing because of course we need to validate

269
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,790
they have the entering the same passwords right here.

270
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,900
And then of course when we log again we are not going to work when we were just or we are not going

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,480
to log in the user directly.

272
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,050
We're going to say OK everything went OK go to the log and we're going to take you to the log in.

273
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,380
And you know enter your information your user and password and log in.

274
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,410
So we're going to do that.

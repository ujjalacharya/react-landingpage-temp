1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:05,240
All right so we don't have not found section.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,710
So I'm going to add it right now should be really simple for you at this point.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,720
We kind of did it many many many times.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,400
So I'm going to store the the not found component inside of you tells.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,790
I'm going to create and you filed cold.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,460
Page Not Found done jazz.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,920
So this one will be a re-act statelets components of course.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,120
And I'm going to call it again.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,960
Page not found not found because it can add an icon.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,910
You can you can do it if you wish.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,810
So I'm going to bring import import font.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,480
Awesome.

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,700
Awesome.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,830
And then I called my hands are a little bit cold.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:59,110
We are mid winter right now and in my country winter home in really cold.

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,210
So if you remember it's Fort Austin and then react for it awesome then import.

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:16,440
And then the icon calls F A exclamation and then circle no real long keyboard.

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,200
So from at that we're awesome.

19
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,820
And then Fortt awesome free and we copy a exclamation right.

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,020
Whoops there we go.

21
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,630
OK.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,870
So pretty simple.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,700
I'm just going to be returning the container the class name with the container right.

24
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:46,200
Then I going to go here and say OK I want to create a div with a class name of not found container.

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,600
And again don't take the CSSA reference.

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,770
And then I get to make reference to that font.

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,740
Awesome icon.

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:00,110
So font awesome opening close and we need to pass the icon and the icon f a exclamation mark.

29
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,830
All right.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,790
And then I get to it you know just say something maybe whoops coma and then Page Not Found.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,400
Right.

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,670
Page Not Found.

33
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,620
Right.

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,770
Very very simple.

35
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,440
So now of course we need to include this within routes so I'm going to go to routes and I'm going to

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,540
import it right here the top maybe at the bottom because this is not a very common route.

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,700
So import then.

38
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:40,480
Page not found from that forward slash components forward slash U tails and then a page not found.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,530
Right now we need to put it always at the end.

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,420
It's the last route on the list.

41
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,710
So I'm going to copy the home just like it is and I'm going to paste it right here.

42
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Now we need to remove the path.

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,750
So by default is going to go to this component.

44
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,700
If we if it's not finding the route we don't really need to know.

45
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,220
So I'm going to say Page not found for a component and we are done.

46
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,990
Really really simple.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,850
Of course the app reloads this one should fail and we get oops.

48
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,080
Page Not Found.

49
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,340
And if we go I don't know two guitars and then forward slash and whatever.

50
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,920
Oops.

51
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,550
Page Not Found.

52
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,560
Very good.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,200
You can put it read direkt right here.

54
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,180
Maybe go to home or whatever.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,980
It's completely up to you at this point.

56
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,880
This should be piece of cake.

57
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,050
Piece of cake.

58
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,110
OK.

59
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,720
So we are we're going to again sip the big project and let's move forward to the next component.

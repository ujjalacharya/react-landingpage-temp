1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,690
OK so now we need to create around with API users download and a D to you know get the download really

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,650
simple right.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,950
So I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go back to the server now on the server.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,750
We need to create a route that is going to be getting something.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,200
So get then of course we passed the API users and download.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,450
So this one the contents after download.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,500
It's dynamic.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,900
So again just like the like we did with rehang Browder of course this is different but pretty much same

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,410
thing.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,870
We passed Collen and the ID and this is a dynamic value on this one.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,250
Of course we need both and we need admin as well.

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,630
And then we just run a function with request and response request and response.

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,780
Right.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,860
How can we you know send the file or tell the client or send back a request sent down something sent

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,360
to the client the actual file.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,960
Well with a node you get the download property method it it's really really simple.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,560
So first we need to tell the application what download We want to send back to the client.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,630
So we do Konst file I'm going to host it here.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,160
So we do that path the same thing we did before Pat.

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:26,210
Then we go to resolve opening close and we pass the you know this location than we do plus and we do

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,490
OK.

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:34,430
We want to enter the uploads for Slash bloats just like this forward slash and the name of the file

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,140
and the name of the file since we are passing this as you know a dynamic value.

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,750
We get it inside to request that pair of rams Dodd and then Id if we put a I don't know something like

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,840
the something here.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,680
Like I don't know file name.

27
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,870
This should be filing of course.

28
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,830
All right.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,620
How can we send the response with a download file.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,260
We send the response and we used to download it.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
No real simple.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,070
And then we say file OK we want to send the response with this file.

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:12,320
So now when we make a request to this one we should be getting you know something to download.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,370
So I'm going to go to this one and we get it in the fight when we do it right here in documents and

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,060
if I go here we get it.

36
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,230
If I open this

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,190
right here's the file.

38
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,590
You know Reader It is simple.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,380
Go to another one.

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,490
We get it.

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,200
Very good.

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,280
So of course we're going to close it and this lay out it's pretty pretty basic.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,420
You can and you should.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,190
You know do something much better with this.

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,480
But remember all the information it's inside the items and you just need the actual name.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,780
That's the only thing we need.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Maybe if you want more detailed information and this maybe you will need to go to the database.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,950
You know the data uploaded.

49
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,210
And you know all the other information.

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,770
So in that case yeah you need to go to Mongo.

51
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,280
But in this case it's just a simple example in how to upload a file.

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,070
OK.

53
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,360
So just like before.

54
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,930
I'm going to skip all of this content I can to make it a little bit better.

55
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,690
I'm going to change maybe the place where I'm requiring multo and everything else but I'm going to make

56
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,010
it a little bit better and I'm going to upload everything so you can download it and of course you can

57
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,630
get it from get help.

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,750
And I believe it the next module and check the next bonus section.

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,580
Oh the next bonus is the reset passport.

60
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,370
That's when it's very useful.

61
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,710
So I need to log on.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,590
What happens if I want to log in I want to log in and I forgot my password so he can go to a forgat

63
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,400
passport.

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
We will put in the e-mail and we will send an e-mail to the user with the token.

65
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,350
And whenever we access to the token we can check on the server if the token is valid and everything

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,720
else.

67
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,000
And we're going to let the user change the password.

68
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,930
You know the usual stuff when we forget a password.

69
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,450
So that's the next bonus section.

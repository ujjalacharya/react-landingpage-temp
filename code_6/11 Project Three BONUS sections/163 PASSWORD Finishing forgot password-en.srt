1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,540
Right.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,710
So back in the recent past whenever we submit the form.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:13,630
Of course we're going to do this and we're going to do a big expose expose no X hosts post opening close.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,440
Right.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,750
So we need the route.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,120
It's API users and reset passport.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,030
And of course maybe maybe thinking well we spend a lot of time doing this.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:33,000
Well not really if you know what to do because after a while you will you will know what to do.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,510
It's going to take you maybe half an hour maybe a little bit more but that's that's it.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,690
So of course what we need to do we need to send the data we want to submit.

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,980
So I need to put the data to submit which contains the password.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,130
Just one password right now.

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,450
They Ballie date revalidate passed with confirm password just this one but we also need the reset token

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,060
remember that the server looks by token.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,000
So we need to pass the password and the token.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,530
So again data Sabet and doing some destructuring some putting inside of here whatever we have inside

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:16,870
data to submit and then I'm doing that reset token equals to does that state that reset token remember

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,290
we are setting the value of this right here.

19
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,840
All right so now the server will be receiving this.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,340
And I I was telling you after a while this is going to be easy for you because you going to do it several

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,190
times.

22
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,410
So response.

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:41,060
And now of course it takes more time video because in talking at the same time that's why.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,890
But in real life this is going to be much faster.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,420
So OK so now of course on the year when the promise gets solved we get a response.

26
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,750
And we have two possible scenarios we have.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,400
If everything goes ok of everything goes bad which means that the token it's not valid.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,990
So if the response and I'm going to do it right here if the response that data that success remember

29
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,750
we are setting sending a success just like this.

30
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,780
It's of course falls then what we would do with it.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:23,910
So show the error so this that set state opening close and we're going to set the form are to true coma.

32
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,830
And then they form an error message.

33
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,780
Remember here.

34
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,270
All right.

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,100
The form error message.

36
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,030
It's going to be equal to the message we are sending right here.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,440
The sorry token bed and everything else.

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,670
So this one is going to be inside responds that data and then message.

39
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,810
Right.

40
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,570
So if everything goes OK we want to do of course.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,890
Something else we want to set the time out and you know set the state a form error back to false.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,880
But in this time again a form error.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,960
Let me do it first form error.

44
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,220
Back to false.

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,390
Go back to false.

46
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,760
And then we have the form success.

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,710
So it's going to be koma.

48
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,030
Sorry.

49
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,420
Come on.

50
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,340
For him success.

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,450
And it's going to be equal to true.

52
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:19,050
Now after a while and we can do pretty much the same thing with it with the register whenever everything

53
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,070
is OK.

54
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,680
I want to show a dialogue and this dialogue will be of course shown to the screen whenever we change

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,230
to form success to.

56
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:34,540
And then after a while I want to do the set timeout to kick the user back to the log in you know so

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,700
they can enter with a new password.

58
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,800
And this is going to pass.

59
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,200
It's going to go up two or three seconds.

60
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:48,000
And of course this that props that history history that push.

61
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,140
And then we push it back to register log in.

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,850
All right.

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,850
Looks nice.

64
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,170
Hopefully again no errors if not of course any possible deal.

65
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,500
Chuck what's wrong.

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,450
All right.

67
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,390
So OK.

68
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,700
So everything looks correct so let's give it a try and then go here.

69
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,050
And of course I need to do the whole process again because we have the.

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,960
But we could be wrong so I'm going to go back to logon right back to home and I'm going to use the account

71
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,950
of this dude.

72
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,960
This guy Frances Jones Oh I'm sorry.

73
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,850
Before we do that we are not going to get a form that we are not going to see anything on the screen

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,040
if everything goes OK.

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,480
We need to add that dialogue.

76
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,360
So I'm going to copy go to register and copy the dialogue.

77
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,510
I forgot to do it.

78
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:48,720
So I'm going to go to the bottom and maybe after the form Yeah that's OK we could say congratulations

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,470
or no.

80
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,340
All right.

81
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,410
Something like that doesn't matter.

82
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,830
And password.

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't know your password.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
I don't know why we said.

85
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,600
And you will be directed.

86
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,290
You know something real simple.

87
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,790
Now remember that we are listening for the forms access so whenever we change it if everything goes

88
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,960
OK to true this dialog will show.

89
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,500
Ryan.

90
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,150
That's the idea.

91
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,640
Same thing like that before.

92
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,120
All right so now we are ready to try again.

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,020
So in.

94
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,620
Of course we bet we failed to remember the password.

95
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,070
So log in.

96
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:38,140
I believe it was we said user sorry we're going to add one and the minute reset user.

97
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,850
All right.

98
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,600
So now I want to reset.

99
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,130
FRANCES JONES done.

100
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,360
All right.

101
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,990
I'm going to go back to waves and we get the reset passport and reopen it.

102
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,560
Now it's the correct token.

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,780
So the default password for this do it's password 1 2 3.

104
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:06,030
I can change it to password 1 2 3 4 and then password 1 2 3 4.

105
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,800
All right.

106
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,340
Of course reset password and write your passwords was was a we said no errors on the server.

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,750
Let's try again.

108
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,270
I'm going to try to enter with the password 2:59 which is the old one.

109
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,490
So passport 2:59 log in it fails.

110
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,690
And if I add a for we are good to go.

111
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,280
It works no errors right man.

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,160
So OK.

113
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,470
So what is next.

114
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,330
And it's the last thing we're going to do.

115
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,520
It's to go to the log in and at the bottom.

116
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,580
Let's do that right now.

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,130
OK.

118
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,950
So the components of this button it was there were just a log in and it's inside the log in.

119
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,820
So I'm going to go after the log in get the log in right here.

120
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,560
So good copy the button and it's a little bit.

121
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,910
We're going to do it really fast.

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,270
Get copied and put this and say for God my passport.

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,050
Now I'm not going to be I'm not going to add a link because we will need to change the styles a lot.

124
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,130
So I'm just going to keep that unclick and I'm going to add style to this Bunim because it's not it's

125
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,680
going to look a little bit weird.

126
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,480
So I'm going to do margin and then left you can you can do it if you wish.

127
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,140
Doesn't matter.

128
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,110
It's just a timing thing than 10 pixels.

129
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,890
And the unclick instead of of course submitting the form.

130
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,930
What we want to do is redirect the user to a new place.

131
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:46,950
So I'm going to get at this and do the events well and whenever we unclick we do this that probs that

132
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,700
history that push.

133
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
All right.

134
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,400
And then of course we go to reset and then user.

135
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,300
All right.

136
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,040
Looks good.

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,330
Now remember at the top you're using with the router.

138
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,000
So that prompts a history push should be working.

139
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,190
So I'm going to reload the application and we get the forget passport and if you look at we go to the

140
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,240
route.

141
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,660
All right.

142
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,600
So everything goes.

143
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,260
Everything works of course.

144
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,850
Snip everything and put it in.

145
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,980
So you can you can get the code and that's it for now.

146
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,300
This is the last of the bonus of course are going to be adding some more but not this week maybe the

147
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,720
next one or maybe in a couple of weeks.

1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,370
Write so before using Mongo D-B we need to install it.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,530
So I'm going to go to the browser and I'm going to say Mongo D-B just like that.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,420
And of course it's going to be pretty much the same there.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,370
The first result Maunganui to be for giant ideas.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,170
We're going to go there and OK you're going to have a bunch of data right here a bunch of options.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,830
We're going to go right here to the one that says download on top and we're going to go to download

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,380
and we need to select.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,630
And again you can have a lot of options but begin to use the one that says community server.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,860
Because of course it's free.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,820
So if you're you need to select the person that you're going to use.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,560
In this case we are a Mac so I'm going to use OSX 10 64 bits with S as well.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,130
We're going to use that one.

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,790
And then of course we need to download.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,940
So I'm going to click and download OK it's going to start downloading it just one second and I'm going

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,840
to save it into downloads.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,230
So it's it's going to be like 90 megabytes.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,490
It's going to take a few minutes.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,770
So I'm going to parse the BDO and be right back.

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,410
OK so now everything is downloaded.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,540
So what we need to do we need to go to downloads and we need to extract the the folder.

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,830
Gays can take a few seconds.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,650
OK.

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,590
It's going to give you a folder you know this folder Mongul divi OSX and then the version.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,750
And what we do now is to grab this folder and drop it inside the boot directory or your user directory.

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,510
In my case it's going to be Apple.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,950
OK I'm just going to drop it here and it's going to get it's going to be right here if you don't have

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,690
this option on the favorites.

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,300
What you can do on the finder right here you can go to go and you can have an option that's going to

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,570
say home.

30
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,630
So you know same directory.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,340
So now what we need to do this folder.

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,780
We need to change the name.

33
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,030
We need to rename it.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,500
So we're going to rename it to Monga.

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,830
Now the next thing is going to be to create a new folder.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,140
It's going to be Mongo hyphen data.

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,960
So this Mongul data folder is going to host all the information about the database that you're going

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,000
to create inside this folder.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,470
So this one is going to be the one that is going to host all that data.

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,560
So now what we need to do we need to start the server and connect to Mongo.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,280
So I'm going to go right here and we need to navigate to this Mongo folder.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,130
I am at home root.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:32,400
So what we can do is say CD Mungo for Slash and we can go to the bin folder to the bin directory.

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,110
Now if I do is going to get a lot of directories and there is two that begin to use begin to use the

45
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,510
Mongo and the Mongo D.

46
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:48,410
So Mongo D is the one that is going is going to start to server so we can make no rescue operations

47
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,290
and Mogo is going to be the one that is going to connect with Mongul D.

48
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,220
So these two are the ones that we're going to use.

49
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,080
OK.

50
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,910
So now before doing anything we need to start to server and to let Mongo d what is going to be the location

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,210
of the database which in this case is going to be Mongo data right here.

52
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:19,130
So first we're going to do that for I-Slash and we're going to use Mongo D then we do minus minus D.B

53
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,900
and then path and then we need to make a space and we need to specify the location for Mongo data.

54
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:33,910
We're going to use the tiller and then for Slash and then Mongo hyphen data.

55
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,790
Now if you press enter it's going to start doing some weird thing

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,780
OK almost on an alley and you're going to get a message that's going to say waiting for connections

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,230
on port 2 7 0 1 7.

58
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,760
This means that the server is running and it's ready to go.

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,680
So now the right side on the terminal going to make a right click and I'm going to open a new tab.

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:11,030
So this new tab notice that I am I am already the Ben location inside Mungo So this tap with this tab

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,130
we you're going to connect to this server that we have running right here.

62
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,570
So we're beginning to do it's really really simple.

63
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,020
We need to do that for flash and then Mongo.

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,910
So he's going to give you a lot of information and notice that you don't have the command.

65
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,830
You have just the ride ponding pointing arrow.

66
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,190
So this is just like note.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,860
This means that you are running and then you can run Mongo divi commands right here.

68
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,450
You can use the database and if you go to the Mongo the right here you can have some information that's

69
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,620
going to say received climate data from localhost.

70
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:54,320
And you know who's going to give you some bunch of information Mongo shell and then the type of computer

71
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,250
that received this connection which is going to be Darwin and Mac OS which is my computer you know local

72
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,080
host.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,780
That's good.

74
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,490
You know so your ready to go.

75
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:09,200
So I'm going to go to right here to Mungo and I'm going to just run some tests I'm going to say D.B

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,940
and this is the way we connect with the database going to create a dummy record inside Mongo DB.

77
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:23,000
So I got to say D-B they're going to say test and this is going to be the name of our database.

78
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,460
We don't have a database right here.

79
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,510
But since it's not there is going to create it.

80
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,120
I believe that by default.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,040
Not really sure that by default with Mongo D-B you get a test D-B by default.

82
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,570
Now it doesn't matter if it's not there it's going to create us it's going to create this database for

83
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,410
us.

84
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,830
So we're going to say insert and with this we will insert new data.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,500
And I'm just going to do curly braces and just going to add name and of course Francis.

86
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,680
Now I'm going to press enter.

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,710
I was going to say.

88
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,200
Right.

89
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,470
We sold and inserted one.

90
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,900
So this means that it's good you know.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,470
We have one record when went day two month old baby went to the database and inserted one record.

92
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,980
So how can we check if this record exist.

93
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:20,750
So we're going to say again same thing D.B than we do test and we do find now the find method is going

94
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,210
to show you all the records in that database.

95
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,720
So going to press enter and it's going to give me this as a return.

96
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,370
We have an ID and we're going to talk about this I.D. later.

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,330
And then name and Francis this I.D. It's unique.

98
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,570
It's something that Mungo TV it's doing by default is going to provide you with the default I.D. but

99
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,280
this is this comes from Mongo D-B you know everything is working.

100
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,990
We are running the show the database you're connecting and we are just adding some records.

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,730
OK that's good.

102
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,860
But you know if you if we need to create a project and we need to do a lot of operations with the databases

103
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,080
you know just checking everything from the terminal it's just like a pain in the butt.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,910
You know we can be typing the whole time.

105
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,460
It's going to be really really long.

106
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:18,230
So we have some tools that can help us to inspect the information you know in a little bit more Rafic

107
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,980
way.

108
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,060
We have something that is going to be called rubber Mongo.

109
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,830
So just get ready to install rebloom on go in just one second.

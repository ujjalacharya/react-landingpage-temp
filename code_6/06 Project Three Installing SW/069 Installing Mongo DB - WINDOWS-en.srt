1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,480
So let's install Mongo.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,310
I'm going to go right here to the browser.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,150
I'm going to say Mongo D-B.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,730
So OK.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,880
So we going to have this option here.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,630
Mulga would you be for giant ideas.

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,460
It is going to be Mongo D-B dot com.

8
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,790
So I'm going to click on it and it's going take us here.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:23,290
So on the top right hand corner you can have a button that it's going to say downloads so we click download.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,460
And again we can have several options.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,140
The one we care is going to be the community server.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,600
That one is free.

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,410
You know the word community.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,790
So again we can have several options.

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:41,120
The one we need is going to be Windows Server 64 bit and later with S S L support Sevigny so that selected

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,220
that one they're going to click download and you know it's quite large it's going to wait it's going

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,920
to wait like I don't know 150 megabytes So that's going to take a while.

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,940
So I'm going to pass the Berio coffee and be right back.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,940
OK so everything is ready.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,150
So I'm going to click the installer is going to give me the run and just click click and run.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,020
OK.

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,350
We're going to do next and accept terms.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,620
Now it's going to give you two choices to complete.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,380
And the custom of going to choose the complete and then of course we will click install is going to

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,700
ask me if I'm I'm sure just wait for it.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,790
And yeah I'm sure go.

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,240
OK.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,390
So it's installing.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
It's going to take a few seconds.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,070
There we go.

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,930
Almost done.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,080
And I get it finished so I'm going to call it unfinished.

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,310
So now what we need to do we need to do two things.

34
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,830
First we need to start the Mongo divi server and then we need to connect to the Mongo divi server.

35
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:52,480
So to do this we can open a new command and open ACMD it right here and go into navigate to the root

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,800
folder to see so I'm going to say CD for Slash is going to take me just right to it.

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,260
Now I'm going to open the explore.

38
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,590
I'm going to go to a local disk program files right here inside program files.

39
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,150
We can have mango DV and then server and then the version which is the 3.4.

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,690
So we need to navigate to this location.

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,510
So we're going to do cd than Program Files.

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,470
My mistake.

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,550
Let's go again.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,440
CD program files.

45
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,740
Oh sorry my mistake again.

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,560
Let's go back.

47
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,810
So again see the server that program then files and it's going to be for Slash.

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:48,250
We need to go to Mongo Mungo D-B for Slash and then server forward slash go again server for Slash.

49
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,120
And the person is going to be the three that for that.

50
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,750
Fortunately again and when he entered the bin folder.

51
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,460
Good.

52
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,610
So now right here.

53
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,160
I'm going to say there is going to give me a lot of options right here.

54
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,460
A lot of executables.

55
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,730
And there is of all the options.

56
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,990
This two are the ones we care the Mongo that the SC and the Mongo D that exist.

57
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,220
So the Mongo D is going to start the server and the Mongo that he is going to connect to that server.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,360
So now with Mac or Linux what we can do we can go to the local disk and enter users and create a folder

59
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,240
where we're going to install all this all the same I'm sorry we're we going to store all the databases

60
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,420
so I could do it right here under my user.

61
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,310
But with windows that my cats cause some problems.

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,630
So the Mogo divi by default uses the default folder inside the local disks.

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,860
So for windows we can do the local disk.

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,680
See that's going to be the difference.

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,950
So we need to create a folder that is going to be data and inside the data folder we're going to do

66
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,520
a new file folder folder that is going to be the be.

67
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,680
Right.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,890
So now I'm going to go right here and I'm going to execute this Mongo D that easy.

69
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,860
It's going to go right here and say Mongo D that e x c and then just enter.

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,170
It's going to do a bunch of stuff you know it's going to take a second.

71
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,210
And at the end you can negate you're going out waiting for connections on port 2 7 0 1 7.

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,080
That's cut.

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,590
So if you get this it means that it's working.

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,610
So we can open a new and I'm going to do reichlich and then command prompt going to do pretty much the

75
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,790
same thing that before.

76
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,460
Going to do CD4 slash is going to take us back.

77
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,780
And we need to re-enter to the same location again.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:05:00,090
CD program files for I-Slash Mongo D-B for Slash server for Slash 3.4 for slash and burn.

79
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,560
So now here we're going to start instead of the Mago de Mongo that you see.

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,970
So this Mongo that easy is going to do something and then it's going to connect with with the with the

81
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,020
Mongo the instance that we have right here.

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:24,950
If it's not connecting go back to the Mongo D and do Control-C that is actually an error that is happening

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,390
with Mongo that DXi.

84
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,120
But you know it's going to work.

85
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,410
So you're going to get something like a connection except that one connection open it is going to give

86
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,120
you information about your operating system.

87
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,630
In this case it's going to be Windows Microsoft and whatever.

88
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,880
So this means that you're connected.

89
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,690
You know this instance is connected and right here you're going to get the you're going to get a right

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,590
pointing arrow just like we'd get with node.

91
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,060
Whenever we start node with the rebel.

92
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,620
Well this is the same idea.

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,350
Now we are inside Mongo and we can run Mongo commands.

94
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,630
So.

95
00:05:59,660 --> 00:05:59,990
OK.

96
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,220
What I'm going to do I'm going to go right here.

97
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm not going to say the B and begin to start a database.

98
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,470
I'm going to say divi that test that's going to be the name of the database and I'm just going to insert

99
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,230
some data.

100
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:20,730
So we're going to do dot and we're going to do insert now insert we do open and close parenthesis and

101
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,340
right here.

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,970
I'm going to pass an object so the object of course is going to be some Jason data.

103
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,690
So we're going to do.

104
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,860
Name and of course you guessed it Francis.

105
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,670
There we go.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:39,320
So when I press Enter it's going to try to insert this record into Mongo Mongul D-B folder.

107
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,550
It's taken a while so maybe it's frozen will be do with the control see again.

108
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,920
Nothing happens.

109
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,160
Let's see what happens.

110
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,860
OK.

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,710
So I press enter.

112
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,690
Sorry for that.

113
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,440
And this right result and we get and inserted and then just one.

114
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,630
This means of course that everything went OK.

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,060
And this record was stored inside our Mongo folder.

116
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:12,640
So to check it we're I'm going to do is D-B dot test which is the name of the database and then don't

117
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,840
find this find method is going to bring all the information we have on our database.

118
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,770
So going to press center is going to give me or resolve an ID which is a unique ID that Margot DV is

119
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,890
going to is going to assign to this document and then we have the name Francis So you know Mongo DB

120
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,550
is working now.

121
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,890
We're going to we're going to work with servers and we're going to be inserting data into the Mongo

122
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,390
DVH database and doing it from the command prompt.

123
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,300
And this is kind of a pain in the butt.

124
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,850
So we're not going to do that.

125
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,130
We're going to use a different tool.

126
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:55,470
We can of course use knode but to inspect everything going to do it on a different way we can use rebel

127
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,140
Mongo.

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,450
Now it has a different name.

129
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,160
It was rumormonger in the past.

130
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,040
Now it's going to be called robo or something like robo that treaty or something like that.

131
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,740
But it's the same thing it's the the old the old Rebel Mongo.

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,640
That's fine if it's working.

133
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,100
That's good.

134
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,290
If you had any problems just just sent the chat right here to put it on the Q&amp;A.

135
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,770
And I will answer as soon as I can.

136
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,950
Let's go to the next section and install rebel Mongo.

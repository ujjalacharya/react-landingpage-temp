1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,920
OK so let's install Reber Mongo.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,680
I'm going to go right here to the browser.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,470
I'm going to say rather Mogo.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,430
So you're going to have some results right here and you can have robo 3D formerly Rovell Mongo.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,580
So back in the day when this project started started as Rovell Mongo not rubble.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,360
380.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,380
I believe they had some problems some license's problems problems because it was using the word Mongo

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,280
Mavie Mongo divi ass.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,690
Ask them for money or maybe to change the name so they change it to robo 3.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,030
I liked them more but that's fine.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,730
I'm going to click and download is going to start to download of course.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,100
So I'm going to say download and you know I have it for Mac so we download it.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,590
So it's going to take a few minutes.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,700
I'm going to save it and downloads.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,310
OK so it's going to go.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
I can possibly deal and be right back.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,740
OK so now everything is ready so I'm going to go to documents and you can have the.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,720
I'm sorry to download.

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,340
And you can have the file just right there are going to double click it.

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,000
If it's not old and you open it you need to do control click.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,920
Of course we're going to go to devices and inside devices you can have it right there.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,440
If not you're going to get it inside applications.

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:22,390
If it's not inside applications just like we were going to go to robo 380 and just drop it inside applications.

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,960
So if we search it right here we're going to have it right here.

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,180
Robo 380.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,590
So I'm going to DoubleClick it.

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,980
It's going to take a few seconds.

28
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,160
As I say robo it's not an application downloaded.

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,510
Yeah.

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,110
That's.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,640
We are.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,530
Sure.

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,030
So that is going to open the application.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,650
You might have some things right here.

35
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm going to remove it.

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,110
Going to do it.

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,560
Everything from the start.

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,890
So you can have this panel.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,660
Mongo DB connections.

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,490
So right here we need to go to create inside the create.

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,390
You can have some options and we're going to use the connection for now.

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,890
So we need to give a name to this connection.

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:07,120
So I'm going to call it local local and then MZB for Mongo divi you know local for this computer.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,930
And the address is going to be again just local host and the default port 2:07 is your 1:07.

45
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,230
Then going to click save.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,190
And with this highlighted we're going to do connect.

47
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,990
So in the left you're going to get this you know the system and the test and this is the actual database

48
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,740
that we were we were with did right here you know this record if I double click and test is going to

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,420
give you give us this panel with the actual information that we have on this database you know named

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,340
Francis and the ID.

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,070
This is really really great.

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,050
The other choice would be to do it right here from the terminal which is kind of a pain in the ass.

53
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,850
So right here we can do the information whenever we inserted.

54
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,890
It's going to just out magically appear right here and we can even inspect like this.

55
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,300
We have we have different types of abuse or we can just add data manually.

56
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,160
You know that's really really great.

57
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,810
OK.

58
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,100
So now we are ready to start with Mongo D-B.

59
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,980
So let's go to the next section and start with this.

1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,900
OK so let's insolvable Mungo.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,150
I'm going to go right here.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,340
I'm going to say rubber Mongo.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:14,450
OK so now right here you can have the rubber Mungo dot org which is Robo 330 formerly of Mongo.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
That's the one we need.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,130
So right here we can have two choices.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:26,390
This is the one we want to download robo 3-G so we can click and download and of course we want it for

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,590
Mac and my case is going to be the installer 64 bit.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,940
You have the option for a portable version.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,720
Now just going to go in to install it.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,330
So I'm going to put it in downloads and it's going to take just a few seconds.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,600
It's 11 megabytes.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,600
It's really small so it should be done in a second.

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,510
Everything done.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,770
So I'm just going to click on it and open it and you get a click yes.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,640
And then just next then I agree then next and then then install.

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,290
We just need to keep clicking next.

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,850
So OK I'm going to run the reboot 3 T.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,140
Just real simple.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,250
So of you will do and we and then just next we don't want to do this.

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,690
So I'm going to click and finish and.

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,030
OK.

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:27,010
So the main screen you can have this tiny window and we can have just two choices are going to delete

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,360
and remove all of them maybe because I have them from a previous version.

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,980
So I'm just going to delete them.

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,650
Now what do we need to do with it to click uncreate.

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,950
Right here we have four choices create edit remove and done and clone and then click and create.

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,390
Right here we going to create a new connection.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,220
You can assign whatever name I'm going to put mine.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,550
Local then Robo.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm sorry for Mongo.

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,260
And then we get.

33
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,940
So again it's going to be local host and 27 0 1 7.

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,880
Remember that we have right here Domingo the running on the 2 7 0 1 7.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,420
So I'm going to do save right here.

36
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,390
We're going to have this instance the local MTV.

37
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,470
Again you could use whatever name you want.

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,970
Going to connect.

39
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,460
It's going to take one second and right here on the top left you're going to have local MTV system and

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,350
then test.

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,740
Now if we open this test and if we go to collections and we will talk.

42
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,110
What collections is and document are you going can have the test.

43
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,190
Now if I double click on the on the test you can get right here the information that we've entered previously.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,400
You have the D and the name Francis.

45
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,300
So right here you could have whatever view you can have the table view you can have the Jason view and

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:53,270
we can edit or add some documents some data and modified Vihear directly from this interface.

47
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,100
So this is much much much much easier than doing it from here.

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,590
Right.

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,690
So everything went OK that's good.

50
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,740
This is just a simple application just a simple interface.

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,880
So let's move forward and go to the next section and start using Mongo D-B.

1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,960
OK so now we going be talking about state and for re-act state it's kind of important.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,520
So there's no easy way to understand this.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,640
And if you don't completely get it don't worry.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,460
We're going to use it the whole time so you can get it by practice.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,500
So the state it's an object that serves us like a database so we can be can stored values we can check

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,680
for events you can pretty much control how the application behaves through state.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,070
So remember we talked about functional components and class based components.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:40,060
Well every time we create a class just like this one we have right here we get by default from re-act

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,030
a default state.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,630
And if we have a functional component not like this one we don't have the ability to get a default state.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,920
The functional components don't have state and they are stateless.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,920
And you're going to hear that term a lot stateless but classes classmates based components have a state.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,900
So how can we set a state.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,330
So I'm going to say state just like this.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,270
Just use the keyword state and this one is going to be equal to.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,870
And we open and close an object.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,660
So right here we can put whatever we want to say keyboard's just like an object and keywords is going

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,530
to start with.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,490
Hello.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,520
OK.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,390
So the class starts.

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,530
We're going to set a default value for keywords inside the state.

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:36,480
So inside the render what I could do I can do a console log of this that state that keyboards just like

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,630
this.

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,990
So when the application starts it's going to recognize the state that's going to read the function and

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,280
then it's going to do the render.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,100
And we can get the keyboards.

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,910
Hello.

29
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,110
So we get hello.

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,980
That's good.

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,250
But if you notice this is just it looks like an object.

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,930
So what's the difference between in between using this state and a regular object.

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,420
The thing is that if we change the state re-act is going to recognize that you're changing the state.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,950
And since this is a special property it's going to render the application is going to say Oh OK.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,980
So the dude changed the state.

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,780
So I'm going to re render the application because now for this keyboards we have a new Ballew.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,060
That's the main idea of state.

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,680
So I'm going to commandeer the console and right here instead of doing the console log from the change

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,150
handler you know if I type something we are not getting anything on the console.

40
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,940
I want to change the state.

41
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,330
So in theory if I changed the state every time I type something on the input this render should render

42
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,140
again and we can get the new state of keywords.

43
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,370
So to set States we need to use a pretty fine method.

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,980
We need to use a special method but re-act is going to give us is going to be this dot and we use the

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,940
set state and of course Methot inside we need to pass an object.

46
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,810
And now we need to make a reference of whatever value we want to change.

47
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,500
So we are going to say keyboard's now every time we type something keyboard's is going to be equal to

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,630
event the target value which is equal to whatever we are typing right here.

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,570
So I'm going to copy this and paste it down here.

50
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,050
Now if I type something we're going to get an error.

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,190
And remember I told you about the bind property.

52
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,770
OK.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm going to use it right now and at the end of the section I can explain why I'm using bind and then

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,220
this.

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,900
So the application reloads.

56
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,050
So if I type something is going to go to the change handler This is when it's going to set the state.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,210
And since you're setting a new state the application is going to read render.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,100
OK.

59
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,890
So I'm going to type an F and we are getting the value it's doing this cancel.

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,540
So he's doing the render again.

61
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,840
Let me make this a little bit smaller.

62
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,140
Not like that.

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,750
There we go.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,620
So right now if I type something else f a and this console log it's doing the FAA.

65
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,850
If I type on our air on our sorry.

66
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,140
We're getting far.

67
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,120
OK that's good.

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,660
So every time we type something and we set the state react we renders it's not reloading the page is

69
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,170
just rendering the.

70
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,620
This piece of code.

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,250
Good.

72
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,970
OK.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,660
So now let me explain you a little bit about the scientists.

74
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,870
OK so let me explain you what the mind is doing right here.

75
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,370
So we are.

76
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,310
Let me just first delete this and see that error message again.

77
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm going to type a name and we're getting cannot read properly set state of undefined.

78
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,160
OK.

79
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,690
We're just invoking we are calling this function whenever we make an odd change.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,290
That's good.

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,790
So it's going to go all the way to the top.

82
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,140
Inside the function and it's going to say this.

83
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,810
Now whenever we use a function just like this whenever we make a reference to this it's not going to

84
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,890
be declasse.

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,300
It's not the class header is going to be this function.

86
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:29,360
So whenever we use bind does we're telling that function that whenever we are saying this and this function

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,730
we are saying that whenever we use this keyboard inside of the function.

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,120
This means the actual class you know means the parent component and not the actual function.

89
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,210
That's why we're doing bind this.

90
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,090
So we're telling that whenever we use this inside of the function it means the class.

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,060
So since the class has the said State method we didn't get an error message it's working because the

92
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,080
said state it is defined.

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,950
OK so now the thing is that you're going to crawl the Web maybe in the future you're going to see some

94
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,720
other examples of react and you're going to find this on a different way.

95
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,080
You're not going to see the bind this and you're not going to understand why.

96
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,310
So I'm going the mind is.

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,400
And of course it's not going to work again.

98
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,330
So what can we use we can to use a fat Aro function instead of a function.

99
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,610
Now with iOS 6 the fat Aro functions are really really smart.

100
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,980
They know that whenever you make a reference to this you're meeting the class and not the actual the

101
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,850
actual function.

102
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,040
So if I just check again it's going to work.

103
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,670
So this is working.

104
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,270
So in the future you should avoid using bind and use the new method which is going to be a arrow function

105
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,050
bind.

106
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,990
It's from the old call.

107
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,310
You can still use it for a few other things.

108
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,800
But if you can use a find arrow function that it's better.

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,990
Now I'm telling you this again because you're going to find some examples with mind and you're not going

110
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,150
to know what to do if you don't know this.

111
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,730
OK so what's next next.

112
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,730
All the things that you can find inside the Web is going to be something like this you're going to find

113
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:24,470
a constructor then inside you can have a super And then inside you can have the set state just like

114
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,080
this and inside it instead of a state you're going to find this that state.

115
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,710
So OK.

116
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,260
And inside here I'm going to have something like probably going to be talking about props in a minute.

117
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,010
Don't worry.

118
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,090
So if I try this something like this it's still going to work.

119
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,030
So what this is doing and this is related to the previous section with when we were when we spoke about

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,330
IOS 6 constructor.

121
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,860
So this class it's starting and we are extending component and right here we are creating our own constructor

122
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,700
and right here we are bringing whatever prompts whatever values we get from components.

123
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,720
And this case prompts and then we are setting a new property for this constructor.

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,140
So we are adding this state to the prototype.

125
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,810
Now the thing is that whenever you react the state it's already on the prototype of whatever you are

126
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,580
extending.

127
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,210
So there's no need to do set state.

128
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:29,000
So I was I use this a lot in the past and I'm not using it right now not just using it a lot it's because

129
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,270
state it's already defined inside the components.

130
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,870
It's already in size so there's no need to do the constructor unless you really need for some reason.

131
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,680
So if we type this it's going to work.

132
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,230
So you can manage and you can use state for whatever you want.

133
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm going to delete the hello I'm going to leave the key words empty and I can add a title just like

134
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,830
this.

135
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,300
Let's say that whenever the application loads you want to have some content text right here that maybe

136
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,930
it's going to come from a database.

137
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,480
So this title is maybe the key words something like that something really dumb.

138
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,230
The keywords are common.

139
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,440
So instead of of course coma because this is an object.

140
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:23,480
So instead of putting right here maybe creating a div that says the title is whatever you're going to

141
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,940
just call this that.

142
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,830
Probs sorry not prop's this state and that title just like that and this is going to print whatever

143
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:41,670
you have inside the state it of course if the state changes the application is going to render and you're

144
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:50,340
going to have that does that state just like that this state and then keyboard's.

145
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,990
And whenever I type something we renderers type anay type something is going to rerun under anti-body

146
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,260
and so on and so on.

147
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,290
So no state it's really useful for us.

148
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,350
But the thing is that whenever you use state it's kind of a it's going to be a little bit harder to

149
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,690
maintain.

150
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:18,800
So you should always avoid using class components with states because they use more memory and they

151
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,670
are hard to maintain if you can use a functional components if you can use a functional component that's

152
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,110
better.

153
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:33,500
No that's less code and less logic for you or for your application but of course it's not bad using

154
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,270
class components.

155
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,360
If you really need it you can use it.

156
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:43,070
No problem but you always try to think a little bit more about what you're going to do and what you

157
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,910
need instead of using a class or instead of using a functional component.

158
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,710
OK that's good.

159
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,380
Let's keep moving forward.

160
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Remember I said props right here.

161
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,530
And then I made a mistake saying this that prompts well on the next section we're going to be talking

162
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,360
about props.

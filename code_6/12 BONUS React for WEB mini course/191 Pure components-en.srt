1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,450
Right.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:07,760
So there's a lot of confusion around pure components and they are real simple to understand and I guess

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:14,040
the confusion it's because we need to understand which problems pure components solve.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,500
OK.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,230
So first we can discuss the problem and then I'm going to tell you how to solve it.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,130
So I'm going to go back to life to this route to the life route right here.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,640
And of course we have everything else.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,640
And what I'm going to do I'm going to comment all the code we have right here and I'm just going to

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,540
leave the state.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,750
That's the only thing I'm going to leave right here.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,820
So we have a state with a title which is the text that it's getting rendered right here.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:47,030
If you go at the bottom we have the H-3 with this state title and we have a button to change the title

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,530
to something else.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,780
OK that's reasonable.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,230
Every time that we load this component is going to cancel log or render message right here.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,040
So we get rendered OK that's fine.

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,040
So now if I go to click the change begin to change the title for something else and re-act will render

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,320
this component and show the new title which is something else could.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,520
So I'm going to go and do click to change me on Mark this click the change oh nothing happens.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,210
There we go.

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,640
So we get something else that's good and right here we get the first render with the first title and

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,280
then it's going to be rendered.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,110
So we get the second render.

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,170
So that's good.

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,040
Now what happens if I keep clicking this click change I'm going to go right here.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,180
I'm going to click it and we get the render again if I click it again we get render we get render and

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,230
we get you know we just keep getting render.

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,210
Now if we think about is about this this is the actual problem.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,420
We're not changing the title the title it's always the same it's something else.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,530
Whenever we change it for the first time so why is react.

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,170
Rendering the application since we have the same value.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,470
So this is the problem.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,930
Sometimes you can have a larger application with a lot of data going around and some things are going

34
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,800
to be changing some other things are not going to change but Riak will always be rendered whenever we

35
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,000
trigger something.

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,500
So with pure components we can we can add we could detect if the state changes and if the state changes

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,540
then it's going to render if not it's not going to be rendered.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,960
So if you remember with the chute component update we can do this logic manually going to go in and

39
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,070
comment should component update.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,180
We're going to reload the page.

41
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,020
So right here we are going to say if the next state of title is something else which is what we have

42
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,070
right here the bottom of the return is false.

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,940
So the application will not render.

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,220
So going a click to change and you know it's change you get first and then.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,210
Then they save it again.

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,960
Sorry.

47
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,690
I'm going to go and click the change and of course nothing happens because this rule is met.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,740
So we return false.

49
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,140
Now the thing is that this information it's hard coded.

50
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,150
How can we check the previous state.

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,610
So what we can do we can say this that state and then of course title and we're going to be comparing

52
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,250
the next title which whatever thing that we have inside the state.

53
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,190
So right now we have life cycles and we are changing.

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,540
And of course we are changing to something else.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,290
So the state will not be the same so this will not happen and it's going to go and change the state

56
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,280
and we've rendered the application.

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,430
Notice that right here we get the first render.

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,350
OK so going it could change.

59
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,440
We change it to something else that's good.

60
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,440
So it's rendered for the second time.

61
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,270
So if I click it again it's not going to render this condition is met.

62
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,450
So he's returning false.

63
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,610
Now again imagine you have a lot of data a lot of state going around here.

64
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,740
A lot of information.

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
So what are you going to.

66
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,340
How are you going to create one scenario for every piece of state that you have.

67
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,560
Well that's kind of crazy.

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,400
So re-act is going to give us a component that we can use and this are pure components.

69
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,880
So right here we are doing class lab class life expense component.

70
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,330
So what we can do we can bring pure components.

71
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,080
I'm going to copy and paste it down here.

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,010
I'm going to go at the bottom and again and just comment this out because we are not going to need it.

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,630
OK.

74
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,770
So I'm going to reload the page and click to change it of course the change is going to happen because

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,780
we have something else right here.

76
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,910
Of course we have a different title than it click it.

77
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,170
And of course it's a rendering.

78
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,890
So we get something else.

79
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:48,570
Now if I click that nothing happens the pure components it's checking the state.

80
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,430
And since we don't have a real change inside the state it's not going to do anything good.

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,800
You know this is really really useful and pure components are really popular today.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,570
You know the sense why reloading the whole application if the state it's the same.

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,790
OK that's good.

84
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,100
Let's go to the next.

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,880
The next lecture.

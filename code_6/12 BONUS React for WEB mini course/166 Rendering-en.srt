1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,600
OK so all the files we have right here we are not going to use them.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,490
Of course if you want in the future you can keep them.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,580
But for this course for this basic project that you're going to build We're going to build everything

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,100
from scratch.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,300
So you know there are just in the way.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,450
So I'm going to delete them pretty much are going to read them all.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,940
So I'm going to go right here to the project that they're going to delete the files from here because

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,670
it's easier to link the files from here.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,460
So I'm going to select everything I'm going to unselect the index that I'm going to leave that one I'm

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,060
going to delete everything else going to center trash.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,820
OK.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,200
And then I get to go to the source folder and I'm going to select everything and just leave the index

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,680
non-jazz out and then I'm going to send everything to the trash.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,460
So I'm going to go back to the project and we just have the indexed h d m l and the index that has and

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,680
again we are going to build everything from scratch.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,440
So I'm going to delete everything and then I'm going to save it.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,250
OK.

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,640
So now if five of the application.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,260
Of course nothing works.

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,370
That is good.

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,370
So I got to go back to the project.

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,220
And now whenever we write code for react we use components or buse.

23
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,570
So these are the first key words you need to remember.

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,250
So this components are going to be these pieces of code we connect so they can work together.

25
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,820
So we write everything in javascript but whenever it's compiled it's going to be rendering javascript

26
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,650
and some H-2 him out.

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,810
So again in re-act we create functions and classes we work with functions and classes but some some

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,680
functions are going to be returning some DML.

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:54,320
But again just like I told you before everything is javascript so this lookalike HMO is going to be

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,440
in reality.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,170
J.S. it's going to be Javascript and this is going to be called J as sex is what right does.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,290
We're going to write some major Gmail that looks like Gmail but then it's going to be compiled and it's

33
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,470
going to be rendering that HD email on the screen but that HD mail is in fact javascript and it's called

34
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,390
GSX.

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,050
So let's create our first component you're going to be starting with that are going to create a rival

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,920
that is going to be Konst and it's going to be called app and this app is going to be equal to fad Aro

37
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,700
function.

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,850
And this one is going to return some code and I'm going to return an H1 tag and inside we can have hello

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,640
then world.

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,530
Simple as that.

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,870
And just exclamation marks.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,540
Now notice that this is just the regular iOS 6 function.

43
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,300
It's a fat arrow function.

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,480
So we get we're going to be using ESX and discourse and if you don't know iOS 6 at all.

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,790
Don't worry just keep watching and we will learn as we go.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,410
Or you can go to the final section of the course and you will have a bonus content is going to be a

47
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:06,200
fool iOS course you can start from there learn your sex and then you can come back.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,340
But if you wish you can stay and just learn as we go don't worry.

49
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:17,510
So this is just the function is going to be equal to function then app then opening close and you know

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,770
just a regular function.

51
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,390
This is the same idea.

52
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,480
OK so let me delete this.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:33,170
OK so now this is our first component if we invoke app is going to return some text some H-1 take some

54
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,030
time out.

55
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,330
Of course if we go right here we get an error.

56
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,660
It's a first error re-act must be in scope when using j as sex.

57
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,560
So OK so let's keep moving forward and see what is missing in our application.

58
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:56,500
So in order for react to compile our component in a code that the browser can understand we need to

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,290
let the script node know that we want to use react because that's what we want to do.

60
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,940
We want to use react.

61
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,450
So we need to bring react to this script.

62
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,410
We need to bring act to the equation.

63
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,780
So how do we do it.

64
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,450
We import things.

65
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:18,670
So at the beginning of this thread we will bring two main libraries or dependencies and we are going

66
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,610
to be making use of the keyboard import than space.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
And we passed the name of the thing that we want to bring in this case.

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,450
We're going to be bringing react and then we're going to say from where we want to bring this.

69
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,060
So I'm going to say from now are going to say space and in single quotes I'm going to put the name of

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,670
what I want to bring.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
It's going to be react.

72
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,050
So what's happening right this is that node is going to say OK this dude wants to bring something that

73
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,710
calls react and it's going to get a wanted from react.

74
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,010
So whenever we don't have an extension just like this for example node knows that we whenever we put

75
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,510
a name just like this knows that we want to bring something from the node modules from the vendor folder.

76
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,560
So it's going to goes to the Bendre folder bring everything and put it right here.

77
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,330
So we need two things.

78
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,800
The first one is react and then we're going to need something else.

79
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,520
We're going to say import and begin to say react.

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,360
Damn just like that react and then dorm.

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,430
And of course we want to bring it from re-act dawn.

82
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,380
That this our domain of dependencies of libraries that we need to work would react.

83
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,310
And if we go to the package that Jason you can see that you have it as dependencies react and we act

84
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,660
on it.

85
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,490
Let me close this.

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,320
So what happens.

87
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,950
So let me save the page and if we go right here we render nothing happens.

88
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,490
But you're not getting this message right here.

89
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,400
Let's go to the inspect and check the console.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,050
OK re-act arm is defined but never used up is designed.

91
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,100
But valy never use.

92
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,830
We're going to get to getting a different message right here.

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,330
OK.

94
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,150
So let's go back to the code.

95
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,240
So OK we have our component we have the dependencies.

96
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,430
So now we need to show decode.

97
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,210
So we explicitly need to say react.

98
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,700
Here's my component and this is what I want to render.

99
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,500
So we are going to be making use of Riyadh.

100
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,880
Damn I gotta go.

101
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,620
Right here up bottom and I'm going to call this react dumb.

102
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,880
I have it right here.

103
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,060
So we act dumb.

104
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,640
It's going to be using a method.

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,570
So this method is going to call render and this vendor is going to take some arguments.

106
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,630
Now of course we are not there yet.

107
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:47,310
So this argument that we need to do is our component we'd say dude render our component.

108
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,440
So I'm going to go right here and we're going to say app we need to render this one.

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,020
OK.

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,450
So if I go right here of course we get a new message target container.

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,080
It's not a dom elements.

112
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,930
So whenever we use this just like this we are saying that we want to render a component class are going

113
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,620
to be talking about this later.

114
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,000
So what we should pass.

115
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,160
It's a component instance.

116
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,140
So we need to say we need to explicit say Dude this component this right here at this function.

117
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,230
It's a component so you need to render as a component.

118
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:33,550
So what we do we enclose everything in attack just like this just like an HDMI attack Walt same idea.

119
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,370
And if I save this and go to the browser it's going to be working.

120
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,060
But we get kind of a kind of a different a different message a different error message.

121
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,720
So I'm going to go back to the project and this render method is going to need this one which is going

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,790
to be the component.

123
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,680
But then it's going to need to know where to put it.

124
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,640
Right here we are telling what we will want to render but not where we want to put this.

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,090
So the second argument is going to be the where.

126
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,140
Now if I go to the HMO and we take a look right here we have a div that is going to be called rude and

127
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,300
this is a convention you can use whatever name you wish.

128
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,810
But of course you need to specify and index.

129
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,980
By default we called Rule root and it's a convention.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,910
So if I go to the index as the second argument is going to be that rude and right here we're going to

131
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,840
be using Document dot Querrey selector and this is vanilla.

132
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,400
Jazz is going to be crazy selector.

133
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,710
And then of course we pass the name of the ID which is going to be rude.

134
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,950
So I'm going to save it.

135
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,710
Let me make it right.

136
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,300
So the everything should be working.

137
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,420
If I go right here.

138
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:49,780
OK.

139
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,480
We get.

140
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,940
Hello world.

141
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,950
Everything works.

142
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,890
So what is happening to some.

143
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,470
Everything everything up.

144
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,410
We are importing react.

145
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,020
We are creating a component that returns some DML and this e-mail.

146
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:11,620
In fact it's going to be Javascript is GSX but re-act is having this converting everything to email

147
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,670
and then we pass the initialiser to the function that returns that code.

148
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,660
And we are saying where we want to put it.

149
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,630
And then of course it's creating the bundle legist and the Vonda that Jesus is putting everything everything

150
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,960
inside this container.

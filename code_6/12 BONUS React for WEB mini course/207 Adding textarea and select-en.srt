1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,850
OK so now what can you be doing.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,580
We're going to be adding different scenarios.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,960
So so far we just have an input.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,880
You know we an 11 type of input.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,460
So what happens if we want to add a text area or maybe select.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,150
So that's what we're going to be doing or doing right now.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,840
Let's say we want to add Selecta I'm sorry a text area one so I got to go right here at the bottom after

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,050
the last name and I'm going to be adding and using Harry for this.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,540
It's going to be message.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,550
The message is going to of course contain some configuration.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,070
I'm going to copy the one on top and you know paste it right here.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,220
The type is not going to be an input.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,630
We need a different scenario so it's going to be text area.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,970
But then we have a value.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,170
The label is going to be true the label text is going to be message whatever then the config and the

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,280
config it's going to be a little bit different because you know we have a different configuration for

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,590
text areas.

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,210
So but the name is still still the same.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,720
We're going to say message.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,480
Now we don't need the type and we don't need the placeholder but inside a text area.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,990
What we can do we can use rose and we can use calls.

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,180
I'm going to say rows and calls.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,680
It's going to be equal to 36 something big.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,430
So far so good.

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,320
You know everything is looks nice.

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,800
The only thing that it's missing right now is the template part inside here.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,740
We only have a case for inputs.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,520
So we need to add a case for text areas.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,420
So I'm going to say cased opening close and then text area now text area.

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,940
Of course never forget to do the break inside text.

31
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,980
Arianne what we want to do we want to catch this scenario scenario and return a template.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,660
So it's going to be formed template equals to you know some GSX.

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,620
Now the data sets for this is going to be really really simple.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,430
So I'm going to backspace and now what we need to do first we need to return a dev you know one element

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,170
now inside the diff.

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,490
We still have a label song to copy the one we have on top and pasted.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,070
So now we want to do.

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,160
And if I say this note is that I begin to get the label.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,500
So this is working.

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,320
So what we want to do we want to return a text area got to open and close the text area.

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,200
You know I'm going to just not make an self-closing tag text area in the text area and received some

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,330
configuration.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,810
And again we have the configuration inside config Raheel config.

44
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,940
We have the name the rows in the calls.

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,460
So we're going to do just like with it before Bally use that config going to go right here and paste

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,280
it.

47
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,570
What else do we have.

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,870
We have a value so I'm going to copy the values and paste that right here.

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,280
We have an on change so we can paste the On Change event so we can update the state of this one.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,500
So the next thing is going to be you know nothing else.

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,290
That's the only thing that we need to do.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,090
I'm going to delete the text area and then not make it a self-closing tag.

53
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,450
So all this is what we need because of the configuration we have the value.

54
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,040
And we have the onchange handler.

55
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,410
So everything is ready.

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,040
So if I go right here we get the message and the text area is working OK.

57
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,250
So going to reload the page and go back to user.

58
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,730
Now what I want to do I want to cancel logged the date it's met.

59
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,340
So whenever we submit I want to check that we are getting all the information correctly.

60
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,670
So I'm going to go to the form and I'm going to say Francis I'm going to say Jones and for the message

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,420
I'm going to say hello guys were going to submit and if I check the data to submit we get last name

62
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,470
Jones message.

63
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,010
Hello guys and name Francis.

64
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,460
So it's working.

65
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,180
So again it was really easy.

66
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,090
The only thing that we needed to do of course add the template in this case.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,350
But if you from the future we've already have this template now for a text area.

68
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,300
The only thing we need to do is to add a message here and that's it.

69
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,720
It's really simple once you.

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,890
You were done with as you create all the logic for this.

71
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,090
Just at this and maybe on the future you're going to be working with different projects you can make

72
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,120
a lot of Web applications and you can copy all of this logic to this works like a template.

73
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,370
And you don't have to code all over again you just copy paste and you pass an object.

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,640
And since you did this you did all the logic to make this work.

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,850
You know how it works.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,650
OK.

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,520
So OK so we have a text area.

78
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,210
Let's add a select.

79
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,970
It's going to be a little bit different.

80
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,810
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and are going to do coma and I'm going to create a select

81
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,910
for age.

82
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,040
Really real simple I get copy all of the things we have the top and paste it.

83
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,270
And now the element of course it's going to be something else.

84
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:06,150
We're going to say that the values still empty label true we can have a label but it's going to say

85
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,930
age.

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,890
Now the config is going to be a little bit different.

87
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,460
The name is still going to be age but we don't have rows and cause what do we have on the Select.

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,900
We have options.

89
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,580
It's going to create a viral that it's going to be hosting all the options.

90
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,790
We want to show.

91
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,060
And the starters start is going to be an array.

92
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,620
Now inside the array we can have an array of objects.

93
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,110
So then whenever we create select we can loop the options and show the options inside.

94
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,360
So I'm going to save Vau and the first one is going to be equal to 1 and then I'm going to do something

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,180
real simple instead of putting the actual H.

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,080
One two three four five until one whatever are going to say the value one equals to 10.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,520
Tilt swing makes sense.

98
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,500
The next one I'm going to just copy the one on top and paste it at the bottom.

99
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,000
And of course it's going to be de-value number two but it's going to start from 20 and 30 and they are

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,270
going to do one more.

101
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,410
It's going to be the last case the volume number three.

102
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,650
And instead of 20 is going to be Plus than 30.

103
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,390
Now something real simple.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,040
OK.

105
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,770
So everything looks ready.

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,320
So now we need to create a scenario for a select.

107
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,510
So I'm going to go right here.

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,510
The bottom I'm going to say case open close.

109
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,450
And of course it's going to be select.

110
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,280
Never forget to do the break.

111
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,310
If not nothing is going to work.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,270
OK.

113
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,960
So we have we need the form template.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,090
Let me copy this one on top and it's going to be equal to you know some GSX and that's why we use parenthesis.

115
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,880
So this one is going to be real simple.

116
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,060
First then it's going to get a little bit of you know we need to use more logic whenever we need to

117
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,540
return the options.

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,460
But first at first it's going to be the same and the other ones we have a div we show a label if it's

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,560
enabled and then we return a select.

120
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,030
Let me make it like this.

121
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,600
Select So this select has some configuration just like the other ones.

122
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:19,650
But if you notice the other ones have the information inside config and all of this is going inside

123
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,250
the actual attack.

124
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,670
But this one inside the Select we have the name that it's going to go in the tag but then the options

125
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,550
are going to go in a different place.

126
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:37,230
So if we do just something like this inside the select just like this is going to be adding that object

127
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,700
inside the actual sled.

128
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,080
And we don't want that.

129
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,500
So what I'm going to do first I'm going to create a value because we need a value and then for the name

130
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,170
I'm going to make it manually it's going to be name.

131
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:57,910
And then we access use dot config dogs name and then begin to get the name with all of the options.

132
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,200
Of course we need to non-chain on change.

133
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,250
So I'm going to page the on change OK.

134
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,570
So you know we're getting the select and everything else but we don't have options.

135
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,550
So far I'm going to create.

136
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,250
Right here.

137
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,010
Going to be accessing the options inside config.

138
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,850
We're going to loop this because we have an array of objects.

139
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,940
We can do that.

140
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,010
So going to open all the braces.

141
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:27,300
Going to make a reference to values that come Feg DOD options options plural.

142
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,690
And then I'm going to map overhead.

143
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,500
Whenever we run a map we each have an item on each iteration and we have that each number and this one

144
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,180
is going to be equal to a function just like this.

145
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,630
All right.

146
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,350
You know looks good.

147
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:50,760
Now if we do this if we return a function with curly braces we have to make a return right here since

148
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,630
I want to return some GSX.

149
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,870
I can just delete this and just use parenthesis.

150
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,970
And this by default is going to return some GSX you know we know this.

151
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,700
So inside here we're going to be returning an option real simple.

152
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,080
Now the option is to needs to have a key because we are using a loop.

153
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,600
So we need to add the key.

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,670
So we have the I the number.

155
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,720
So everything looks it's going to be fine it's going to just output it.

156
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,000
So we get a net getting an error.

157
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,180
But don't worry you're going to check it in a minute.

158
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,370
So we have a key.

159
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,130
And what else.

160
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,710
We need a value for each option.

161
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,560
We have a value and if we check it right here we have Bahau.

162
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,530
So we are going to say item dot Val.

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,210
Now inside the option again we have a text and if we have read if we check it's going to be text.

164
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:52,180
So we say item dot text you can save it that's going to reload the application and we get an error cannot

165
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,910
read properly.

166
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,020
Map of undefine.

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,130
And this is pretty much maybe because I made a mistake with the name.

168
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:07,330
Let's go to values config options key item you know everything looks nice and you just don't check.

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,040
So I made a mistake right here.

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,160
I say option and or in reality makes sense that it's going to be options.

171
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,230
Because we have more than one.

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,990
And I was going to work.

173
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,580
OK.

174
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,710
So we get age turned 20 30 20 30 and Plaza 30 that looks really bad because I don't have a style for

175
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:25,980
this.

176
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,990
I'm going to be adding this in a minute.

177
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm pretty sure that in your version of this template you're going to get this styling but don't worry

178
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,330
that's fine you're getting the the options 10 20 20 30 plus then 30.

179
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:46,980
So in theory if I select one and submit the form with the other things Francis then Jones and they make

180
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,460
this little bit bigger and a message of hello if I submit this you're going to get an object with the

181
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,570
age of the value which was number two last name message and name.

182
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,660
So everything works as expected.

183
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:08,010
And if in the future you want to you know at a new select you just have to copy the previous one paste

184
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,710
it and change the names of course and the options.

185
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,000
That's the only thing that we need to do.

186
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,560
OK.

187
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,910
So this is good.

188
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,230
Now the only thing that we need to do right now everything it's done but you know we need to validate

189
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,590
things.

190
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,490
We are not going to let the users enter the information that they want.

191
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,110
Know we need to regulate this when we do this a little bit.

192
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,680
So we're going to be adding some validation.

193
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,840
So we're going to be you know start doing that.

194
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,410
So again it's going to take a it's going to take a couple of lectures.

195
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,870
So grab a new cup of coffee and just come back.

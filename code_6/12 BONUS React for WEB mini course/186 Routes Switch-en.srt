1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,280
Right.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,050
So so far we were getting a tiny problem but we fixed it using the exact keyword.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,020
I'm going to leave the exact I'm going to go back to that problem.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,310
I'm going to give you a different solution for this.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,950
So of course if I remove the X act and we go to the main application to home we get home.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,360
But if we go to posts we get home and we get posts and this is because the route is pretty much the

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,390
same right here.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,300
We have four slash and right here we have four slash.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,640
So this passes through and it's rendering the home and the same thing with posts is going to go to the

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,370
next one.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,500
And we have four slash and then posts is going to render that of course you know this makes sense.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,720
Now the thing is that if we put ex-addict just like here we are telling we are prouder that we want

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,180
to rendered this route only if it matches everything that we have in the path.

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,190
And of course that is fixing the problem.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,860
Now a router is going to give us a different solution for this.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,500
We're going to have the ability to use switch.

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,560
So I'm going to do coma and I'm going to bring switch to this just like a majoris crypt switch.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,780
Well same same idea.

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:20,480
I'm going to go at the bottom and I'm going to wrap all the routes inside the switch statement but not

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,610
statement so much good.

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:22,860
OK.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,050
So everything is inside switch.

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,820
So how how is this going to work.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,430
OK.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,150
So in theory if I just really love the application and I made a mistake is going to be switch just like

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,950
that or reload the application.

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,630
Everything works good.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,590
You know we go to home.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,150
We go to posts profile and everything works great.

30
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,020
But the problem is that we're still using Excel.

31
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,420
So if I remove this it should be working right.

32
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:51,860
OK.

33
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,700
So that's really the application.

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,790
If I go to home we get home if I go to posts we get home.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,960
We are not getting posts at all at all.

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,170
And if you go to profile.

37
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,760
Same thing.

38
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,330
We are just getting home.

39
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,150
So how this switch is working.

40
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,600
How does this work.

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,730
So if this switch is just like a switch statement just vanilla javascript switch is going to start checking

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,970
the route is going to get around right here.

43
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,280
It's going to start checking the routes is going to say OK.

44
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,040
Does this match the criteria.

45
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,970
Yes because we have a latch.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,080
It's going to be rendering this one which is home which is what we get and everything else.

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,420
It's not going to be rendered.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,540
It's just a rendering.

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,220
The first one that matches the criteria.

50
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,150
OK.

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,560
And if you go to post of course not that's going work.

52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,920
Let me just remove this just like this.

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,610
If you go to posts of course we get posts we get home.

54
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,850
We are of course we are not getting home we will get nothing because we didn't have that route.

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,900
If you go to a profile you know it works.

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,710
But the thing is that we need a home.

57
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,770
So how can we make this work.

58
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,200
OK so I'm going to grab this one.

59
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,920
It just says just chop it and paste it at the end of the switch.

60
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,830
Of course if I do this it should be working well.

61
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,140
Yeah.

62
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,100
We go to home.

63
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,850
If you go to posts we are getting posts.

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:21,800
If you go to a profile of your getting profile so the the logic behind that is is that this works like

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,900
a switch statement.

66
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,290
We need to send all the less specific routes.

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,330
At the end of the chain and the more specific routes at the top.

68
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,920
For example if we start checking posts Let's go to posts.

69
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,580
Going to go to posts.

70
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,830
Number two and remember we added a username.

71
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,610
I'm going to say Francis whatever.

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:50,510
If I go right here you know you're not getting the ID and Francis it's because this one matches this

73
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,630
one so search is going to render this one but not the other one so it's not going to go here.

74
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,350
So again same then before we need to put this one at the end of the chain because it's less specific.

75
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,660
And if we notice of course this one it's really really specific.

76
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,060
OK.

77
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,200
With that logic let's just check it out.

78
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,210
If you go to two and Francis we are getting the tomb Francis we go to posts we get posts and profile

79
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,870
and home.

80
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:25,010
So everything works remember with search send the less specific routes on the bottom and the most specific

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,240
routes up top.

82
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,990
And that way it's going to work just fine.

83
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,100
OK so let's move forward.

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,910
Let's go to the next section.

85
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:39,260
We're going to be talking about the red redirections and the 4 0 4 page because of course you always

86
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,000
need for 0 4 pitch.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,650
Let's go to the next section.

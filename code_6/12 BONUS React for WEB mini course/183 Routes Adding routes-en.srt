1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,400
All right.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,380
So since we have a clean clean project we need to have of course an index base index page.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,060
This is what we have in this Digest.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,990
This is going to be the starting of our application.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,620
Of course we need to do a lot of set up.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,470
First we need to import just like we did before.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,490
Let's create the first template for this.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,990
It's going to be import the first components componentry import from Riyadh and we're going to be doing

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,020
this a lot.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,080
Then of course we are going to need import to react on.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,800
We need to bring react Dom to the equation and then we act on from.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And then of course react down just like it's all before.

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,190
So it is good if you have a template now.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,290
Our main application the main start of the main component of our application is going to be of just

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,620
a functional functional of components.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,940
We don't need a class for this so I'm going to say Konst and it's going to be app and it's going to

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,820
be equal to a function.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,950
And of course we're going to return something.

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,500
And for now you're going to return some dumb dip just like that and is going to say home whatever.

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,270
Good.

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:08,850
OK.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,370
So now we need to use this re-act Dom.

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,050
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say react and then Dohm dot and we need to call the render

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,450
method the render method it's going to be displaying the app that we have on top.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,740
Good.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
There you go.

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,000
So then coma in which you specify what we're going to be rendering this.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,870
So we say document dot Querrey selector.

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,050
And then of course we select the route remember route on the H.T. now.

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,530
Well that's it.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,120
OK.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,600
In theory if we run this we should be getting at least home.

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:56,970
So I'm going to say NPM start and it's going to go is going to give us 3000 not post just home and we

34
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,640
get home so that it's working great.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,180
So now we are going to be practicing with routes.

36
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,720
So we're just going to go ahead and create the routes I'm going to create a folder that is going to

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,840
be components just like that.

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,470
Just like before and from the start because we have just three different routes.

39
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,230
I'm going to create one file that is going to be home that jast going to create a new one that is going

40
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,340
to be posts that jazz is going to create a new one that is going to be profile that jazz.

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,730
So most of the times when you create your projects you can just do it like this and look at what we

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,290
need to do.

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,540
We need to create some at least a little bit of this to create the components or at least whatever we

44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,530
rendered this posts we can get some text.

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,570
So first we need to import react and then from you guessed it react.

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,380
This is going to be a functional component so we don't need to do much right here.

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm going to say Konst posts because we are inside posts and is going to be equal to open close and

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,980
just to function.

49
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,540
So this one of course is going to return open close and we need to return a dev.

50
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,880
Just like with that before and this one is going to save posts so we can know at least which component

51
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,920
we are rendering.

52
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,310
Of course we need to make this component available from all other components.

53
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,490
So we're going to say the font and then we pass posts.

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,270
So everything is good.

55
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,110
So in theory of course it's not going to work.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,200
If we change it right here we need to include this.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,230
But first we copy all of this and I get to go home.

58
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,710
I'm going to paste it and I'm just going to change the names.

59
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,750
That's the only thing that we are going to do right now.

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,630
Home then home.

61
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,200
And of course home.

62
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:53,060
Then we have profile so we get to paste it up sorry when you copy paste it.

63
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,420
And this one is going to be profile OCHA profile.

64
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,250
And then again profile.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,050
So OK so we have all the buse ready now we need to start using.

66
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,500
Finally we are going to be using re-act router.

67
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,710
So again we installed we've installed and router as a dependency.

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,730
We have we have it right here.

69
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,460
So what we need to do we need to bring the package and begin to say import and then open it close curly

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,200
braces because you're going to be bringing things from re-act Rotterdam that we're going to say from

71
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,670
and then we passed re-act then router and then of course Dom.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,900
Now the first thing that we're going to be bringing is going to be something called browser router.

73
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,850
I know sounds kind of funny.

74
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,980
Browser router.

75
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:49,710
So this this is going to be an object that it's going to interact with the history and it's good to

76
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,580
know know pretty much it's going to know what's happening on the your l.

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,910
OK so this one is the first one that we need and we need to bring something else we need.

78
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,180
We need to bring something that is going to be called route with a capital R.

79
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:12,600
So this route is the one that knows what to do when the browser router is saying that the world changed.

80
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,210
OK.

81
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,620
Again this one interacts with the you are l with history and this one is going to go and execute whatever

82
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,010
the browser router is going to pass.

83
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,620
OK.

84
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,760
That's good.

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,390
Now we need to import the components we just created.

86
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:33,220
So I'm going to put a comment I'm going to say components just like that components.

87
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,960
We need to import and we need to import first home.

88
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,530
It's going to be from and we're going to go forward slash components and then home.

89
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,910
OK what else we need to import.

90
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,270
And then we need to import posts posts.

91
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,030
We need to import it from DOD for Slash components and then posts.

92
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,120
Right.

93
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,340
We have one more to go.

94
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,590
It's going to be profile then from and then dart forward slash components and profile.

95
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,610
You know we did all this in just a couple of minutes.

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,170
Is you get the idea of how to how to do it.

97
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,740
You're going to do it really really fast.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,440
OK so now we need to start using routes.

99
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,730
We brought this browser router and the route now inside of the app when we're going to do.

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,730
I'm going to delete this just for now and whenever we have an application and we want to use routes

101
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,620
our main application the starting of our application which is in this case is going to be app.

102
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,000
It needs to wrap everything whole up to application inside the router.

103
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,020
So we're going to be using this browser router I'm going to open and close a tack just like this and

104
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,720
then open and close it.

105
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,470
Of course you're going to get some errors but that's fine.

106
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,570
Oh model can resolve components and Profar maybe made a mistake.

107
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,440
It's going to be profiles on the make sure profile look at.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,850
That's good.

109
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,860
I made a mistake with an aim but you know we're just going to leave it like that.

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,130
So now whenever we use a browser or router we can pass routes.

111
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,210
So this route is going to be just like that.

112
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:22,680
Now each crowd has a path the path is going to be whatever this router is going to be listening on the

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,590
history.

114
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,420
So I'm going to say path and it's going to be equal to something.

115
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,020
In this case I'm going to I'm going to pass the posts right here.

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,030
So what we want to do we want to listen for the your L for Slash posts.

117
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,030
It's going to be localhost three thousand four slash posts.

118
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,360
And whenever you use something you see it you use it like this is going to always mean that you want

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,290
the absolute roud which is the domain and then immediately after the fourth slash posts.

120
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,720
So that's going to be where you're going to be using why you're going to be using the the path.

121
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:04,910
Then you have a different option a different attribute and it's going to be components.

122
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:11,250
Whenever we use components we need to tell react and to tell react router which components we want to

123
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,550
render whenever we get this route makes sense.

124
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,770
So right here we are putting posts.

125
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,470
So I'm going to copy posts and put it right here.

126
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,550
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to create the route for the profiles.

127
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,050
OK.

128
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,970
So I'm going to say route.

129
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:37,790
We're going to take a path and the path is going to be profiles called Profiles singler.

130
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:43,080
And then of course we need the components and the components it's going to be just profile.

131
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,490
And then of course we need to close it.

132
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,260
Let me close this so you can see the whole code.

133
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,990
OK.

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,610
If I go to the browser we can get you if you're going to get a router may have only one child element.

135
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,350
So this means pretty much that inside browser router we can cannot have different elements.

136
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,570
This is just like returning some GSX.

137
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,720
We need to wrap everything inside something and that something could be whatever you want.

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,700
In this case I'm just going to use it if something simple.

139
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,830
If I wrap everything inside of the it passes.

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,400
OK.

141
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,130
So we are getting around four posts and profiles.

142
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,770
So in theory if I go to posts we should be getting something going to say posts.

143
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,370
OK.

144
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,390
You know we are getting posts if you go to the post component's this one is just returning posts.

145
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,240
OK let's go to profiles and see what happens.

146
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,760
A go to profile.

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,560
It's profiles and we get profile.

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,500
Let me change it.

149
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,560
I don't like profiles plural.

150
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,770
Let me just bring profile.

151
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
It's going to be profile and ok we get profile.

152
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,550
So you know it works.

153
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,630
Now let's do the home.

154
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,890
Because right now if we go to home you're not getting anything.

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,260
And we have a component for to render the home.

156
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,240
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say route.

157
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,480
OK.

158
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,880
Let me make it self self-closing tag.

159
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,560
And now for the home we're going to be passing the path.

160
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,670
And you know whenever we go home it's going to be pretty much the main domain the local host 3000 in

161
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:28,070
this case so to specify home we're going to use force slash then we're going to specify the components

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,840
and it's going to be home of course.

163
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,000
OK.

164
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,500
So if we go home you know we are getting home now.

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,120
Let's go two posts again and see what happens.

166
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,800
You can go to posts and we get home.

167
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,010
So why are we getting home if I go to posts.

168
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,470
Let's go to the correct route.

169
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,620
We're getting home and posts.

170
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,300
So what is going on right here.

171
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,380
Let me make this a little bit more.

172
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,030
Whenever we load the router we are saying that whenever you get the path of force slash you want to

173
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,960
render home.

174
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,330
So we're getting a fourth slash right here.

175
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,340
So it's rendering home.

176
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,600
Then we past posts and you know we are saying right here that whenever you get posts read their posts.

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,990
So this two routes are valid.

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
That's why we are getting we get we are getting both.

179
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,980
Now there's a way to fix this re-act router is going to give us one more option.

180
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,740
It's going to be the exact that we're going to do something different with this but for now EXACT is

181
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,590
going to work.

182
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:39,080
So if I go to post you know you're not you are now getting on the posts and if you go home of course

183
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,060
we get home.

184
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:48,390
So exact is going to say OK I need to listen to this Pat and it needs to be exact and if it's not render

185
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,690
something else OK.

186
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:57,080
So it's going to the second one in the chain which is this one and it's only rendering posts just like

187
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,330
this.

188
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:07,040
So that works now right here before the routes or after the routes you can output whatever you want.

189
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,130
In this case it is going to create a header tag just like that.

190
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:20,030
And you know again to see Hetter so reload the page we always going to get better the magical thing

191
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,580
about this.

192
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,540
And if I go to posts where getting better.

193
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:30,970
If I go to home we get we still get Hetter And if we go to profile we're still getting beheader.

194
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,890
So whenever you go to different routes you're always going to get the better because you know it's inside

195
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,580
the components.

196
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,850
Now if we look at this this kind of a make sense this is going to be the whole view which is the whole

197
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,700
window.

198
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,800
We have Hetter on top that it's going to be rendered no matter what.

199
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,410
And then of course we have the route.

200
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,710
If we have this case if we are inside home he's going to render whatever you have as a component.

201
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,340
So after the header.

202
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,170
So that's what it's doing.

203
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,260
We go to profile First we get the letter and then we get the profile.

204
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,770
So this works like this you're going to structure this in different ways.

205
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,990
We're going to be creating different routes inside the project we can create different projects and

206
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,030
we're going to be using this and different ways.

207
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,310
So you're going to have different ways to be to use it of course not.

208
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,010
Not this one.

209
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,870
We could create a file that is going to be routes and then import it and use it from there.

210
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,850
That's a different way to use this.

211
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,500
OK.

212
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:31,990
That's fine.

213
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,630
This lecture went too long.

214
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,050
Let's go to the next section.

215
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,930
And I want I would like to do is to add some links right here so we can click the links on the on Hetter

216
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,720
and go to different routes.

217
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,650
Let's go to the next section.

1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,150
OK so now we're going to be talking about drafts but we're not going to spend much time with drafts.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,090
And if you ask why it's because we should not use it you should not use it now because I say it because

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,290
re-act gives you the chance to use them to use refs but they advise not to do it.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:26,580
So it's kind of a link or reference we can attach to an element and then we can use the ref to do things

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:34,200
in the dorm directly and that is the keyword Dom and directly with refs we can bypass react and interact

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,420
with the DOM ourselves not through state or whatever directly.

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:46,620
And if you think about it you can have a Riak discourage you to use it because why use in react if you're

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,260
going to use refs and interact with the DOM directly while using Bre-X.

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,190
So OK it's going hard to explain with words with words how to use a ref.

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,820
So I'm just going to give you a simple simple example.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
I going to go right here.

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,940
I'm going to be using the user view.

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,710
We're going to be right here Peetie user and Jabir of returning the template.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,480
So it is just not to not to create a new project for this.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,700
Going to use this one.

16
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,620
So I'm going to go right here.

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:22,150
I'm going to create an H for an inside the H for I'm going to output the mother.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,250
No Access does not state.

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,840
And the mother.

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,430
If I go right here we're going to get Jane let's get.

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,720
So we know that that's that's working.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,330
I'm going to be adding a style so I'm going to say style equals two and then style just like that.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,520
We don't have a verbal with with the style for this.

24
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,500
So I'm going to go right here on the top.

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,460
I'm going to say Konst style and just going to add some inline styling skin color.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,680
And then there's that state DOT and then color.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,990
OK.

28
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,730
Good.

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,030
So now I'm going to go right here in a coma.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,170
I'm going to add a color and this one is going to be red.

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,120
So when the component really read were renters begin to get Jane.

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,010
And with the color red and of course this one contains an inline styling.

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,550
Me and make it bigger.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,110
Right here we have style and color red.

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,260
But you know we know how to do this.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,590
I to go over here at the bottom and it can add a div.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,150
And with this div whenever we click it begin to be change in the color.

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,860
We'll be updating the color to something else.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,570
So are going to add text change color right here I need to go to use an event.

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,440
So it's going to be on click and this one is going to be equal to and I'm going to a chest book function.

41
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:44,840
It's going to.

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,850
Does that change color

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,970
so that we can have this function.

44
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,690
I'm going to go right here at the top and get a chest created can we change color.

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,540
And it's going to be a function open and close and right here are going to be updating the state.

46
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,910
This is the way we know how to do things.

47
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,980
So I'm going to make a reference to the collar and I'm going to change it to you know how to do this.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,850
So I'm going to click and change color so the color changes to blue.

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,060
Let's get your.

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,540
We are just changing the color through the state overreact but to do this we can use reps are going

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,950
to say ref right here it is going to be equal to name who's going to be my caller.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,860
So now this element this 8:04 tag has a ref or reference to something called My caller.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:48,600
So instead of updating instead of updating the state what I can do I can make a reference to this that

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,430
refs dot and the name of the ref in this case is going to be my caller.

55
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,490
And then again to add the style property which is this one and then I'm going to access the caller inside

56
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,550
and change it to blue get to reload the application and you fight click and change color it's working.

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,940
So you know Same same with salt.

58
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,820
And we even get the style and the color blue.

59
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,820
So this is good.

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,010
You know it's working.

61
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:21,070
We are gives us the ability to do this directly to the Dom but not through the state.

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,490
But again they advise you not to do it this way.

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:33,730
If you can use state the only use in Aereo they they give you that it's kind of a good idea to use refs.

64
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,890
It's going to be with forms and with maybe with the on Blar change on the on the input.

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,930
That's the only the only place where they kind of allow you to use it.

66
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,580
And again you have the ability to use it but you should not use it.

67
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,910
You should use state in this case.

68
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,710
All right that's good.

69
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,570
You know something really simple.

70
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,890
Let's go to the let's go to the next section.

71
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,400
We're going to be starting with new project and we're going to be applying all the things that we learned

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,640
so far is going to be really extends and we can do a lot of things is going to get really complicated

73
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,910
but it's going to close to a real life scenario with the project and we react.

74
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,740
So let's start with the project.

1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,680
All right so we can be doing our practice product for four redux.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,640
It's going to be really small.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,580
We are not going to spend a lot of time.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm going to give you the template of what we're going to be doing because then at the end of the course

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,320
we're going to do a real big project with the redux we react and we're going to be using a real server.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,280
We're going to be using Mongo and mongoose.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,920
So it's going to be is going to be long and I don't want to spend a lot of time on this.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,220
Are we going to do this right now so you can practice redux a plane redux and react on a real kind of

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,250
a real live environment so you can have a little more practice and you can go to your project and apply

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,940
redux on your own.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,330
So okay I'm going to give you a I'm going to give you downlow to go to resources and download this package.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,310
And you only to of course navigate to this to that directory and do NPM install.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,110
This is going to give you the node modules right after you do that do NPM start.

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,490
Just like always and if you go to the package to Jason we have Jason server right here.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:13,380
So we're going to need to be running Jason's server so go right here and do NPM run Jason and then serve.

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,920
This is going to star Jason server right.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,230
If I read the page you should be getting something like this.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,020
All right.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,070
So whenever we click on an artist it's going to take us to the main page of The Artist.

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,820
This comes from the database.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,320
And of course if we type something this of course is not working yet.

22
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,480
If we type Hendrick's is going to filter all the results from the database and give his chest.

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,390
Hendricks that's the idea and everything of course is going through redux.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,940
All right.

25
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,460
So this is what we're going to be doing.

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,780
Let me give you a recap of what we said inside source.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,690
We have the index you know with the router and we are calling routes.

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,740
So routes we have two routes we have home and then we have the artist list which is going to be the

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,410
index page of each artist.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,710
Now inside home if you go to home and we go here we have a class based component and we have we are

31
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,160
importing two components.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,770
We have a state of artists and whatever the application this view gets mounted.

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,880
We're going to be doing a fetch for the artists.

34
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,680
So that list is going to go to the state.

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,790
So right here artists list this component is going to grab that list is going to map it and is going

36
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,600
to show this we can know it's real simple.

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,790
So then we have the search components the search component.

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,360
The only job of the search is going to be passing the On Change event.

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,380
You know the the actual keyboard tell me to go back and to go back home.

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,320
So this search has a function that calls this and key keywords.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,190
So get keywords is going to be grabbing that event and then the event target value.

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:59,990
So if I do comes along by check the log there we go if I type something I'm I'm going to get that event

43
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,550
right.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,040
So that is working.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,620
So what else.

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,470
Well let's say we have the search nothing else.

47
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,700
So we can grab all of this and convert everything to to redux.

48
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,090
Right.

49
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,230
We're using redux.

50
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,830
So let's let's begin doing that right now.

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,990
OK so before we can start anything we need to install all the redux dependencies so we going to go to

52
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,240
the to the tabouli have the server reacts over running.

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,560
We could kill the process and we're going to do.

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Clear right we're going to be installing a lot of things.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,430
So we need to install three main things we need re-act redux we need redux and they begin to be using

56
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,190
something else.

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,990
Didn't show you we're going to learn it on this project that cause redux promise.

58
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,880
So first we need to do NPM install.

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:56,860
Let me make it right and PM install and then it's going to be called react just like we did before redux.

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,560
That's the first thing I'm going to be using a specific version which is the five that 0.6.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,340
OK.

62
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,900
That's that's what they're going to do space and we to install readouts.

63
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,880
And again I'm going to use a version it's three that seven the two this is the latest version so far

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,190
for this course.

65
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,930
So going into space and we're going to be installing redux promise.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,190
Make it bigger.

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:31,630
It's going to be redux and ops or dush and then promise and again 0 5 0 $0.5 3.

68
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,200
And of course we're going to do mine as mine is safe.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,410
So is going to be installing all of this dependencies are going to present or possibly deal and be my

70
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,380
back.

71
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,620
Okay so everything was solved.

72
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,650
Remember to do NPM start back again.

73
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,200
So I'm going to close it.

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,270
And go back to the project since we have the Penzeys everything else what we need to do now is to start

75
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,790
connecting redux.

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,310
Okay.

77
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,670
So we need to we need to do a lot of things a lot of configuration.

78
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,950
So first from Briac redux I'm going to split it just like this.

79
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,940
You need something called provider.

80
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,740
The provider comes from Briac redux.

81
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,360
So it's provider.

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,420
And then of course is space and then from and then react and then redirects.

83
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,320
So what else we're going to need in a create store so I'm going to say import open and close and it's

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,420
going to be create and then store.

85
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,750
Now we're going to use something else because we can apply we're going to be applying middleware be

86
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,070
installed redux promised.

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,300
So we're going to be doing that.

88
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,420
Could we be using that.

89
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,810
So I'm going to say apply and then middleware.

90
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:37,900
Okay.

91
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,350
So this one is going to come from redux it's going to say from.

92
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,550
And then Rydex.

93
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,410
There we go.

94
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,950
What else are we going to use that promise.

95
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,490
So import and then it's called Promise and then middleware.

96
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,500
We're going to see why we are using this in a couple minutes.

97
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:04,500
So we're going to bring this one from redux and then promise but what else.

98
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,190
Nothing else.

99
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,740
This is for now the the only thing we need.

100
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:15,060
Okay so now I don't want to I don't want to that's that's a little bit better.

101
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,150
So I don't want to render an app.

102
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,020
I want to render everything inside the render whenever we redux we of of don't like to do this.

103
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,460
It depends on what we are doing so I'm going to just copy this browser rudder and again it just delete

104
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,340
it.

105
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm going to go right here to the bottom and I'm going to put it right here.

106
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
So now if you remember we need to wrap everything inside the provider.

107
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,260
We need to wrap everything with the provider.

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,920
So first I'm going to be calling of creating a provider.

109
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,590
So it's going to be provider open and close.

110
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,160
And inside we're going to put the browser router.

111
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,170
So this provider needs a store.

112
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,720
So in say space store equal to something.

113
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,590
Now what we need to do we need to pass the connection between the create store and the API with middleware.

114
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:15,800
So going to go right here at the top I'm going to say Konst Konst Konst and then create then store then

115
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,290
with and then middleware.

116
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,330
This one is going to be equal to apply middleware.

117
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,810
Same thing with the Priem Priestley is going to be using this promise made aware and the create store

118
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,540
just like that.

119
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,360
Let me move it just like that.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,390
So now this creates store with where is going to be used it is going to be used by the store inside

121
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,410
the provider now of the creature store with middleware.

122
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,230
Oh sorry.

123
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,990
It's going to be is going to be passing something which is the actual reduce.

124
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,530
We don't have it just yet.

125
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,050
That's why we get an error message so we can to fix it.

126
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,410
Let's go to source and create a new folder is going to be called reducers just like that.

127
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:06,300
Reducers and each producer folder is going to contain an index non-jazz.

128
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,970
Now if you remember we cannot pass a lot of reducers you know just all of the producers inside here

129
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,620
we cannot import all of them.

130
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,940
What we do we import an index that contains all the reducers to do that we need to combine reducers.

131
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:32,180
So we need to do import opening close and then combine and then reducers and this one comes from redux

132
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:40,630
from Redux I know this the setting up is boring but you know it's something that we need to do.

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,450
So what are we going to be exporting.

134
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,560
It's going to be the route we do sir.

135
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,240
And then we would reduce or he's going to use combined we do sers now combined with juicers of course

136
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,700
the method.

137
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,460
And it's going to need an object I'm going to go right here to the bottom and export it default and

138
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,110
then it's base and rude reducer.

139
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,620
Now this combined reducers is going to need a list of reducers.

140
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,420
We're going to have only one for now.

141
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,460
So I'm going to say artists because you know we're working with artists we didn't have this file just

142
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,860
yet.

143
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,130
I'm going to import it right now and we're going to create it in a minute.

144
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:23,050
So we're going to say artists from opening close and then Dopp for Slash and it's going to be on the

145
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,820
same directory.

146
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,250
So we say artist and then we do sir.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,910
We don't have the file that's created right now.

148
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,530
I'm going to copy the name.

149
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,780
Go to reducers create a new file and then you put that non-jazz.

150
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,260
So this one the actual reducer is going to return just to function with an action right.

151
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,010
So we're going to say export default and then function open and close.

152
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:59,060
So this function has two default arguments the first one is the state and by default it's an empty object.

153
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,070
So then we do coma and this reducer is going and we see an action.

154
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:10,100
So we can do right here we can do a switch checking for the action type match the type and do something.

155
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:21,210
So we can do switch just like that open and close and begin to be checking the action dot and then type.

156
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,110
Now for now we didn't have a real action we don't have a type.

157
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:33,760
So we're going to say just by default default opening close and begin to return and then state and that's

158
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,960
it for now this is get we don't have anything we're going to created create this.

159
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,230
The the cases as we go.

160
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,560
So I'm going to save it and if we reload the application we're still going to get this.

161
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,720
And it's because we didn't import.

162
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,990
We are not passing a valid reducer.

163
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,300
So we need to do that.

164
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:00,400
So I'm going to go work here at the top and I'm going to say import reducers from and then dot for Slash

165
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,450
and then we do hers and say we want to bring the index.

166
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,340
There's no need to do for Slash and index.

167
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,220
So going to save it.

168
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,030
We're going to reload the application.

169
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,250
Oh sorry I forgot to do this.

170
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,750
We need to pass it to the create store with midways.

171
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,320
So we're going to reload it and everything works right.

172
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,300
So everything works fine.

173
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,320
Now of course we have the provider and we have a store we are using redux.

174
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,600
We are not using any actions in anything else but everything is connected.

175
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:39,780
So the next thing is going to be going to the actual components and start creating containers and creating

176
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,700
the actions and everything else so let's do that right now.

1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:08,300
So whenever reacts reactor starts the application and starts building a component or updating or receiving

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,570
prompts or whatever re-act is going to do everything in steps inside a component.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,480
So this steps are going to be called re-act life cycles.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:27,050
So OK I have I've created a class based component just rendering just some GSX you know just a normal

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,530
class based component nothing magical right here.

6
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,360
And I've created a route for this.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,660
So since now you can use you know how to use routes you can create one in your own you know right here

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,160
and go to live and I get lifecycle is really simple.

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,890
We know how to do this.

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,580
So now I'm going to go right here and look at I've created the class re-act is going to be using this

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,340
component and then just rendering some.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,190
So of course we are just rendering this but a lot of things happened before we render something so re-act

13
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,110
is going to do everything in steps.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,990
The first the first step is going to be get default prompts just like that.

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,530
When a reactor starts that component is going to get the default prompts.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,850
That's why whenever we go right here and we say cancel log there's the props.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,090
The props are available for us to use inside the render.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,060
Because this is the first thing that we act it's doing.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,600
It's the setting that default prompts inside the components.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,820
So if I go right here we have the prompts that we have router it's passing remember that we react router

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,980
we get the prompts.

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,840
OK so that's good.

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,710
That's the first thing that it's going to do going to come in this.

24
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,580
The second thing that re-act is going to do is going to set the default state.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,170
Right now we don't have a state.

26
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,580
So we're going to do it right now said default and then state this is the second thing that re-act is

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,170
going to do.

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,030
We're going to say state equals to something and then it's going to be equal to title.

29
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,680
And I get to do this get a copy and paste it.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,620
So this is the second step.

31
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:14,450
And that's why whenever we go to render and we say this that state that title is going to be available

32
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,900
for us inside this state OK.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,580
So I'm going to say this that state that title just like that.

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,680
And of course you're getting.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,760
We get we are getting the title and this is the second thing that re-act is going to do.

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,860
Then we have a third step that is going to be before render just like that.

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,490
And I'm going to go back in a minute.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
So the fourth step is going to be the actual render.

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,480
You know just renders Jim.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,290
Sex sex and make this right.

41
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:57,390
This is the fourth step and that we have an additional step that is going to be five after GSX we have

42
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,360
access to before and after the render method.

43
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,290
OK.

44
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:09,900
So that before render we can have access to some default some built in methods just like render if we

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,620
think about it.

46
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:18,360
Render is a default method method from react inside here we have one that is going to be called component

47
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:28,900
will mount going to say components just like that component and then well and then mount open it close.

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,520
So this component this code this method is going to always render before something gets rendered is

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,120
going to get called before we were under something.

50
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,920
So right here is going to say cancel log opening close and just going to pass this tax so we can view

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
it on the screen.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,320
And after re-act is going to render this re-act is going to run this first is going to render this and

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,490
that it's going to run a different method that is going to be called instead of component will amount

54
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:05,550
it's going to be components components did mount open and close.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,490
Now I'm going to do the same thing after GSX after render let's call it after render makes more sense

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,120
to say console log opening close.

57
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,820
And then after render.

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,610
Right.

59
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,730
So if we go right here we are getting the life cycles and then we get three before render and five after

60
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,480
render.

61
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,240
So re-act is going to start the component is going to set the default.

62
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,010
So the state is going to run this code and notice that I'm not running this code and I'm calling this

63
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,630
method is running by default is going to be executed by react.

64
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,180
So we get three before rendering then is going to render the GSX.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,150
That's why we get life cycles.

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,020
And then of course we get five after render.

67
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,900
It's going to go and by default run this component it mouth.

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,300
OK that's good.

69
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,500
So no.

70
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,960
Notice what happens if I'm going to copy and it's just going to chomp it and put it before the component.

71
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:08,590
Well now we know that javascript executes executes everything in a single order.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,030
So if I put it before the computer it will mount.

73
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,650
This is still going to be executed after that component will mount still working.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
So let me let me do something else.

75
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm going to go right here.

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,920
I going to say on the component will amount I'm going to say documents just like that document dot then

77
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:39,000
query selector and I get to select the three TAC right from the Dom can say age 3 and they are going

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,550
to change the style is going to change the color to something else style that color.

79
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,200
And then it's going to say that it's going to be equal to red.

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,710
So let me come this.

81
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,380
Now if I copy this let me just read the application.

82
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm going to mistake.

83
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,440
I meant to type a get one second let me copy this.

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,990
Just gonna delete it.

85
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,890
OK.

86
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:13,770
So if I paste this on the browser we are changing the color of the three tag right directly from the

87
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,640
DOM.

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,390
Now if I run this code on the component will mounth we're going to get an error just like we were getting

89
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,310
before and reloaded and cannot read properly style of no.

90
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,150
So we are trying to change something the color of something and H-3 task that doesn't exist.

91
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,310
Remember that component will mount.

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,110
We'll run before the render so we don't have this inside the Dom just yet.

93
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,440
And of course we get the error and nothing gets rendered.

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,340
Now if I do the same thing just going to copy and paste on the component did mounth we are doing it

95
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,260
because this code was rendered and then this method was executed.

96
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:02,060
That's why we're able to change the color so we have a lot more of this we can do a lot more thanks.

97
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,190
Let's go to the next section and just move forward this.

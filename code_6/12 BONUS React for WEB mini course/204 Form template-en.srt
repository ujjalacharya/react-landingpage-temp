1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,510
OK so now would be going to be doing is going to be creating a template that it's going to be adding

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,760
the all the inputs of a form for us is going to be using a different component and we're going to do

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,660
better.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,340
We're going to do everything else but we're going to be doing everything kind of in a different way

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,230
with control and control.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,790
We're going to do something else and we're going to do this is going to be a little bit hard to understand

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,060
if you can.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,820
It's going to be a little bit confusing.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,110
But this is going to be an approach a more realistic approach.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,860
OK.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,720
So OK.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,160
So let's begin build on this are going to go to the user buse and go to user.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,060
I get just nothing you know as user are going to do this and I'm going to be starting doing this.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,610
I can see a class name and I'm going to give it a class name a container just like the all the ones

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,620
container.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,790
And inside here we're going to have a form and this form will have an on submit.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,740
Of course we didn't have that function but we will create it in a few seconds.

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,060
So it is going to be calling whenever we submit the form we're going to use a function that calls on.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,550
So sorry is going to be called Mid form.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,210
That's good.

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,940
What else.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,700
We need a button right here.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,010
So we're going to say Bunin and this one is going to be saying have met and right here we can have the

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,880
type off the bottom which is going to be met.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,980
Right.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,430
So now in the middle we should be getting all the inputs.

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,370
If I check this we get nothing but we're going to be doing something different right now.

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,140
The main idea of doing all of this is to call to a component to include components that is going to

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,050
be receiving some state.

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:44,270
Now inside the state we can have all the inputs that this component needs to create and to go to state.

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,890
And I'm going to create a new key that is going to be called Forum data just like that.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,680
And this form data is going to have a bunch of information.

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,850
So let's say we want to add a name and a last name just like with did before.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,400
OK.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,740
So going to say name and then I'm going to pass a lot of values.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,180
So this name first I need to specify which type of input we want to add.

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,310
So we are going to say elements and this is going to be kind of the name of what we want to add.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,620
So it's going to be input.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
And of course don't worry this is going to make sense in a minute.

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,740
This input is going to have a value of nothing.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,270
Whenever the application renders.

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,860
Now we can have each input.

43
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,990
It can have a label.

44
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,660
So I'm going to specify if we want a label for this one so I'm going to say label true.

45
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,150
We're going to do koma.

46
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,150
What else do we need.

47
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,990
Even if the label is true we need to have a Leavell text.

48
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,860
So I'm going to say label and text and the text for this one is going to be name right.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,860
OK.

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:56,210
So now impled contains a configuration just like a name the imperative type and maybe a placeholder.

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,440
So I'm going to create a new value that is going to it's going to be called config and this config is

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,800
going to contain all the options of what we need.

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,750
So this input is going to have a name and I get to give it a name of name.

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,420
Input makes sense in a coma.

55
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,200
This input is going to be of type and it's going to be of typed text.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
What else are we going to be adding a placeholder.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,490
So it's going to be place holder and this placeholder is going to have a placeholder.

58
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,120
Enter your name.

59
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,340
So pretty much all of this information is what we need to create an input right from a template.

60
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,570
Right.

61
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,330
We have the name the tax the placeholder the value the label and you know the type of the element.

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,380
This cases in input are going to be creating a new one.

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,770
Right here we have a name.

64
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,150
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom get a copy of this I'm going to paste it at the bottom.

65
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,430
Remember to put a coma because it's an object.

66
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,000
And this one is going to be called last name.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,760
OK.

68
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,490
Now we need to change things here just change it a little bit.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,990
This one is going to be last name last name and the name of the input is going to be called last name

70
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,360
and then enter your last name right.

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,010
So now what do we do.

72
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
What why are we doing this.

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,470
So now the main idea of doing this is that we can create a function or a component that is going to

74
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,710
be grabbing this form data is going to be looping.

75
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,260
Whatever we have in the form data is going to create a template for each input out magically.

76
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,360
So if we have 100 inputs at the end we can have 100 inputs right here.

77
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,250
And the only thing that we need to add is going to be just a new element inside for data.

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,080
You know it is kind of different because the all the way we have to enter each input manually.

79
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,820
Right here inside the render.

80
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,280
So the advantage of using this is that you know we have a more controlled way to enter inputs to create

81
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,760
inputs.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,540
So you're kind of creating a template function to create the the form elements so now we don't have

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,600
that function.

84
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,430
So we can be created right now.

85
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm going to go to source and inside source just like with did before going to create a new component

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:18,250
that is going to be called with widgets but inside these widgets are going to have you know a new folder

87
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,730
that is going to say forms just to make it a little bit more correct.

88
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,050
And inside forms I'm going to have a new file that is going to be called form fields.

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,990
You know you can call them whatever you want.

90
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,680
So form fields of course is going to be just a function that is going to be receiving whatever we passed

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,800
right here inside form data is going to create the inputs.

92
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:50,480
So I'm going to say import react when you make it right react from and then react good we need to created

93
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:59,440
you know the actual function is going to be called form fields form fields and this form fields is going

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,230
to be receiving prompts you know the state of whatever we want to create and then are going to do export

95
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,410
default.

96
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,910
And then of course you know form fields.

97
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,880
It can be form very low form fields.

98
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,120
So now this form fields it's going to be rendering something of course.

99
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,930
So I'm going to be doing this space and I do return opening close.

100
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,590
And what we do on this return we want to return you know a div with something inside.

101
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,410
Now we need to create a function that is going to be having this form data and it's going to be creating

102
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,420
the inputs I'm going to say render and then.

103
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,690
Fields that say the name of function.

104
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,680
We don't have this function.

105
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,680
We get it created in a minute.

106
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,240
Now you know for now we're going to read right now so we can skip that error.

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,300
So I got to say Konst render feels it's going to be equal for now nothing opening close and begin not

108
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,550
going to do anything.

109
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,920
Now we have this component so we need to include it inside users so we can use that component so I'm

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
going to go right here at the top.

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,820
I'm going to say import and then form fields.

112
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,450
From.

113
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,490
And then of course we have dot dot for Slash.

114
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,750
We enter widgets and we enter forms and we enter from tails.

115
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,590
So now this components it's available for us to use.

116
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,800
OK.

117
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,750
So now the next step would be to use this component and start passing all the props that we need.

118
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,670
We're going to go right here.

119
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,310
I'm going to be you know just creating this is going to be form fields opening close.

120
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,360
You know self-closing tag that.

121
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,670
So what do we need for this form fields to work.

122
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,930
We're going to need all the information about our form our inputs are going to go right here and are

123
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,380
going to be passing a prompt.

124
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,470
So it's going to be form and I'm to call form data.

125
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,160
We shouldn't skip this but you know whatever we're going to see later.

126
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,770
So I'm going to say that the form data the information that we have inside this group is going to be

127
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:20,590
this DOD State DOD and then form data which is equal to all of this.

128
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,700
Right.

129
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,340
Where are we going to be adding more more stuff right here.

130
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,860
But for now this is all we need.

131
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,950
So this one feels is going to receive a prop called forms data.

132
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,620
So let's go to form fields and let's start creating this render fields because it's really important.

133
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,420
So okay.

134
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,000
So let me tell you what I'm going to do.

135
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,340
I'm going to create a function I'm going to create a viable that is going to be storing all the information

136
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,320
that we have inside here.

137
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,830
Now if you notice this one it's not an array of objects object.

138
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,010
So what are we going to be doing is going to get that Propst.

139
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,750
And there's this form data and you know structure the information in the way we need.

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,620
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and going to a concert and then form and then array is going

141
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,150
to be equal to an array.

142
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:16,030
So now what we need to do we need to kind of create a way you know we need to run a function that is

143
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,610
going to be grabbing whatever we have inside form data and it's going to be putting the information

144
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,370
inside the form array.

145
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,770
So going to use of for now for its ESX they're really really good.

146
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,940
You know they are really good to use is really useful for us.

147
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,850
So first I'm going to create a viable that is going to be called element and then name just like that

148
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,930
element name.

149
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,590
And what are you going to be looping.

150
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,190
It's going to be the information that we have inside form data that we're in.

151
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:55,590
Can it be you can see this and it is going to be prop's that is going to be looping form and then data.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,340
So now we're pretty much doing we're looping this prop's form data and in each iteration we're going

153
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,440
to be storing that particular item inside element that name.

154
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,120
So what I want to do I want to grab the item and store it inside form array.

155
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:19,180
So I'm going to say form array dot push open it close.

156
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,720
And what I want to do first I want to know the id of the elements I'm going to put name of ID which

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,540
is going to be the element name.

158
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,930
So I'm going to copy and paste it right here.

159
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,290
Now I'm going to do coma.

160
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,450
I'm going to do settings just like that settings and settings.

161
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:46,090
It's going to be equal to props that form data from data and are going to be putting the element name

162
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,230
I know that this doesn't make sense.

163
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,390
I could explain it in a minute.

164
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,470
Don't worry.

165
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,520
And then what I'm going to do I'm going to do console log the form array you know just to see what we

166
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,490
get.

167
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,610
OK.

168
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,860
So let me tell you what is happening right here.

169
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,770
We are calling this form fields and we are passing forward form data.

170
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,070
So it's going to be this is when is non-array.

171
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,480
So we have to have two different inputs.

172
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,740
You know that name and the last name.

173
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,110
So then of course we render feels is going to go to this function is going to create an empty form array

174
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,270
viable.

175
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,330
Now there we're going to be a looping this form data.

176
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Now on each iteration of course we have the data that we have inside each element and then we have the

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,390
name of the element you know the key.

178
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:43,260
So the main idea of doing this is that we want to create one specific item just one item for each input

179
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,600
that contains an ID which is going to be you know the name of each input and then inside settings we

180
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,550
can have the rest of the information which is going to be this one.

181
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,540
All right.

182
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:01,890
So let's go right here and you know just below the page and right here since we're doing consul lawk

183
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,860
form array we got an array of objects and each arrays can to each area.

184
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,630
Each object contains an ID of the name of the input and then the settings.

185
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,800
Which is all the configuration that we need to create this element.

186
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,620
So now the the the next thing is going to be running a function to doing something that is going to

187
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,500
be looping this form array and it's going to create one input for each ID.

188
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,590
Right one with ID of name and then another one with the last name.

189
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,120
OK.

190
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,360
So I'm going to do this and delete this.

191
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,250
And this one is going to be it's going to be returning the information that we need to render right

192
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,470
here of course they're going to say return again to be accessing this form array.

193
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,420
We're going to be looping in a loop over it.

194
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:57,720
Now each iteration contains an item you know and then the iteration number going to run a function right

195
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,860
now.

196
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,740
So this function is going to be returning something and what we are going to be returning is going to

197
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,590
be the actual template you know the actual input.

198
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,350
So I'm going to say dev open it close and remember that when we iterate over something we need to pass

199
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:21,420
a key and the key is going to be the iteration number are going to be adding a class name of form underscore

200
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,920
element.

201
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,930
Good.

202
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,330
And now inside here what we need to do we need to pass the information we need to create the actual

203
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:30,780
input.

204
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,490
We're going to be doing this in a minute but for now we can decide to make sure that we are looping

205
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,840
everything correctly.

206
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:46,010
So if I say input input and we are passing two different inputs we should be getting input twice so

207
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,420
you know it is kind of working.

208
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,470
So now OK let's go back to form fields.

209
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,670
Now this whenever we look we need to create the input.

210
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,110
Now what are we going to be doing.

211
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,970
Are going to be creating a function that is going to be entering the data that we have the configuration

212
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,320
and is going to check for each element.

213
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,180
What type of element we have in this case we have an input.

214
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,570
So is going to access a switch just like that before is going to access that template.

215
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,770
It's going to be returning a configuration that we have for a type of input.

216
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,610
Now for now we just have two inputs.

217
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,310
It's going to be the same template but then we're going to be adding a text area and the select.

218
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,090
So we can have a different type of elements if we have a select.

219
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,840
The element is going to be select.

220
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,240
So it's going to be entering a different template.

221
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,030
So OK so let's you know start creating this.

222
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,840
So now I'm going to be creating a function of course the video is going to it's going to be going to

223
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,150
long.

224
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,920
How are be going to be going to the next section.

225
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,680
But you know I'm just going to start creating it right now.

226
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,220
So this function is going to be called render templates make sense.

227
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,760
And on each iteration I'm going to be passing the item.

228
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,650
You know this item equals to whatever information we have right here on each iteration.

229
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,680
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'll be going to be calling this rendered templates

230
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,530
that is going to be equal to you know a function.

231
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,610
And you just open and close it.

232
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:22,110
So this render templates is going to be receiving some data which is the actual item.

233
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,120
Now whenever we do this and we find that we create a search and switch and we find the template that

234
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:34,700
we want to render we need to access the information that we have inside you know inside config.

235
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:43,690
And if you remember the item contains the information about item dot setting's dot and then config.

236
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,560
So just to make make everything less full I'm going to create a viable that is going to be called values

237
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,250
and it's values it's going to be equal to data that settings.

238
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,560
So now instead of doing inside the template data that settings that config and then whatever we're just

239
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,670
going to say.

240
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,210
Right.

241
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,150
Just creating an alias for this.

242
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:13,650
Now we need a template so I'm going to say let and then form a template that is going to be null at

243
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,770
the beginning.

244
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,670
OK.

245
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,910
It could be empty.

246
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,030
Doesn't matter we are going to say this does matter.

247
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,470
And now right here we need to create a switch that is going to be checking the data that setting that

248
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,470
element and it's going to be deciding if you want to render an input or select or whatever we want to

249
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,820
render.

250
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:40,270
So if we were going to create a switch that is going to be accessing values dot and then the element

251
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,290
now the elements remember is the time of the.

252
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,150
So it's going access input.

253
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:53,870
OK so I'm going to say OK if the case is that we want to render an input we can enter this scenario

254
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,530
scenario.

255
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,410
Of course we need to do a break open and close and now after this.

256
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,800
Of course we don't need a default case.

257
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,240
I'm going to go right here at the bottom again to say the fault.

258
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,430
Now whenever we have a default we need to return or at least something.

259
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,330
So I'm going to say form template is going to be equal to normal.

260
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,120
So you know same thing we could use right here at the top and a the.

261
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,070
And whenever we are done with a switch we want to return the form template.

262
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,650
Right.

263
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:30,580
OK.

264
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,850
So now what we need to do we need to create a template for inputs.

265
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,850
So for now just going to say there and this one is going to be an input.

266
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,400
So if I save it and we go right here we have rendered templates OK.

267
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,480
So it's not defined.

268
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,830
I made a mistake with the names.

269
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,280
I'm pretty sure about that rendered templates won second.

270
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,420
Oh because you know it's a Stigler's component.

271
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,070
So in concert sorry for that.

272
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,720
So OK.

273
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,790
Switch values and that template.

274
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,410
So we have data that settings values and element.

275
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,130
Let me just change it right here.

276
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:16,780
We have data that's setting and it's plural of course remember that we say settings right here.

277
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,690
OK.

278
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,490
Let's get you know we have nothing so far.

279
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,510
But don't worry we're going to be getting something right here.

280
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,950
So let's go to the next section.

281
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,030
And you know start building the actual template.

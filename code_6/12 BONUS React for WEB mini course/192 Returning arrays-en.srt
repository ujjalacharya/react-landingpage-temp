1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:11,230
So ask for the latest version or react we are allowed to directly return arrays in the in the render.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,640
So this is something that we could not do with re-act 15 but now the 16th version it's out so we can

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,030
do it.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,940
So let me show you first with the old ways when they show you the old way and then we'll just refactor

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,030
to the new way.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,340
And of course all the ways are valid.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,400
So I'm going to go to the posts not just inside posts.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,070
We just have three links you know same example than before.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,460
Didn't change anything.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,510
So I'm going to go right here and inside I'm going to create an object an array of objects.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,910
So I'm going to say Konst and going to say IDS is going to be equal to an array an inside a created

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,690
you know the ID for each elements.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,310
Right here we have the posed one to three and then the name of the link.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,850
So I'm going to do that again to say id and the name is going to be equal to post 1 and we need three

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,320
links.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,980
So I'm going to say coma paste.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,340
And then of course coma and paste again they're going to change this.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,650
Two and Three.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,910
And same thing here.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,450
Two and Three.

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,520
You know we have our array.

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,460
So now right here what we need to do we need to do something else on this.

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,270
So we needed to create a variable that hosts a function and this function is going is going to return

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,380
the list is going to loop the array and then return each link.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,430
So OK so I'm going to just say IDs and of course to loop a list.

26
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,550
We're going to be using map and of course map is a method and this one is going to take one item on

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,980
each iteration and then it will return the contents.

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,840
So I'm going to say return and then open it close.

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,340
So now here we need to return one thing.

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,660
So I'm going to wrap everything inside a span and right here we pass.

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,420
It's link.

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,390
So we're going to say link just like that.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,790
And remember that at the top you're importing link from Brianne Groner Dom.

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,920
So going to say link and it's link each item that we return from a map.

35
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,720
In this case meets you have a key.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,060
So we're going to say item that key item that Id sorry.

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,760
Then of course the space we need to pass it to because we have a link and we're going to say item dot

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,510
Id just like that.

39
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,580
OK.

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,520
So sorry I made a mistake.

41
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,950
The key is going to be inside the actual element know the parent element.

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,390
The one that it's containing.

43
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,200
So in this case is going to be the span.

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,000
So after that to what we would need to do we need to close the link just like that.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,620
And right here we need to pass the name.

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,240
So it's going to be item that name.

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,580
And then I'm just going to add just to break me out right here.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,820
Break open and close.

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:56,690
OK.

50
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,440
That's good.

51
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,580
So now what we need to do we need to make a reference to this loop is going to enter the map is going

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,070
to enter the IDs.

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,610
And for each each item is going to return a span with a link.

54
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:16,470
So with this in the past I'm going to go right here to open and close and make a reference to this OK.

55
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,830
So if I go to post we are getting we are getting each link post won.

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,920
You know post 2 and everything else so everything works this way.

57
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:33,550
Now we are using Riak 16 so there's kind of no need to create a viral to host a map.

58
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,070
What we can do we can do it directly in the return statement.

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,390
So we're going to go right here and get a copy.

60
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,460
The whole ID that map and then I'm just going to comment everything.

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,610
I'm going to go right here the return and what we do we just pasted we read the application.

62
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,240
You're getting the same exact result.

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,450
So you know that works.

64
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:05,090
So remember to always return the key of one of the main item on each iteration.

65
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,970
So now we can do more.

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,430
So I'm going to create a going to create a marvel me.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
Let me just do this.

68
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,490
Either way do you have the code right here.

69
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,680
And again common the ID to as well I'm just going to delete all this.

70
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,950
So what we can do as well with the re-act 16 we can return an array.

71
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:32,200
So get to open and close an array after the return and I'm going to say hello coma and then just the

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
space.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,190
I am just like that space.

74
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,130
You know just three values an array with three values a re-act app.

75
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,400
If I save this is going to reload it is going to render all the values we have on the array.

76
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,060
So this one works as well.

77
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,690
And if you think about it this right here is going to be it's a value.

78
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,460
So it's converting the value and outputting text.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,630
So what we can do instead of returning this we could wrap everything inside a div and it's going to

80
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,970
be translated to GSX.

81
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,400
So let me just do it right now.

82
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:20,560
It's going to be dev and I'm just going to replace this and do the same thing with the other ones they

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,500
sold me out to space to save me.

84
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,440
Save it.

85
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,070
And you know we get the same thing.

86
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,420
Hello I am every act up and notice right here that we are getting an error message.

87
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,470
Each child in array should have a key.

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,560
So again whenever we are returning a list of things we always need to add a key for each elements.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,930
So you know same thing I'm going to say key and the problem right here is that we need to hard code

90
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,560
the key and to do the unwon and just the old one and the keys are unique.

91
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,330
OK.

92
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,500
So you Fairouz save it reloaded.

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,980
We are not getting the error message.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,470
And we get the actual result.

95
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,240
OK let's get let's keep moving forward.

96
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,760
We're going to move to h o C's.

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,980
It's going to be it's not going to be that easy to understand because we have many ways to use high

98
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,030
or other components overseas but we're going to do a few things.

99
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,530
It's going to get a little bit confusing.

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,890
So you need to put your thinking hat on.

101
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,250
OK.

102
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,700
Let's go to the next one.

1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:08,590
So when you work with react or any other single page applications such as maybe bew or angular it's

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,440
very common to split everything in tiny tiny pieces.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,390
This is VERY come.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,810
And if you come from maybe Wordpress or the APHC world begin to know that you split everything in tiny

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,100
tiny tiny parts of it so we can do the same thing right here.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,550
Now the first thing that we need to talk about is going to be about project structure begin to build

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,960
on this re-act basics.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,900
S.S. we're going to build a tiny tiny application is going to be in use application and we can have

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:46,720
a header where we can filter some news and inside a different component we can have some news of course.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,720
So first we need to talk about the structure of this.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,600
So I'm going to bring here we can have our application and the first component is going to be the parents

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,570
component.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,950
So we always going to get a parent component that it's going to enclose all the other code all the other

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,410
components.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,240
So the first component is going to be the header so the header is going to contain the logo and then

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,390
we can add some an input text so we can filter some of the news we get at home.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,730
Then we can have a different component which is going to be the news component.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,440
This one is going to hold some other components that are going to be the actual news.

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,500
And now inside you can have each news.

20
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,230
Now we can use one component for all the news items that we get at home.

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:45,740
Now this news item is going to dynamically feed the information about that news to the news component.

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,660
So to sum everything up we can have four different components.

23
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,470
We have the parent component.

24
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,870
We have the better components to begin the news components.

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,810
That's three.

26
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,210
And then the news item we have four components.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,740
Now why are we talking about this.

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,520
Why am i just telling you what we are going to do.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,960
Well I'm not making this up but this is the first thing that you're going to need to do.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,270
Whenever you start a new project you need to stop or five minutes before you start coding and think

31
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,320
about your project structure.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,830
And again I'm not making this up you're going to do it because you need to think what are you going

33
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,930
to use and how are you going to structure.

34
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,550
If you start coding and you make something that it's maybe maybe not.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,300
Right.

36
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,940
Are you going to you're going to go back to your code and start splitting everything again.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,810
And of course if you were a freelancer you're going to be doing it.

38
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,950
And if you work in a company the first reunion the first media that you're going to do with maybe other

39
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,490
developers is going to be about the project structure not about your payment and not about the time

40
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,090
that it's going to take you is going to be the project structure.

41
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,380
Good.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,820
OK let's keep moving forward and start with the new component the first component which is going to

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,950
be beheader So OK so let's create the structure for this.

44
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,470
I'm going to go right here to the directory I'm going to make this a little bit bigger and I get to

45
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,440
go to source now whenever we again we work with this kind of applications you need to have a folder

46
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,590
that contains all your components and you can call these components.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:31,740
As I saw some people I know some people that use abuse or MV includes or templates components imbues

48
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,840
are the most popular ones.

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,410
So I'm going to go to source and I'm going to create a new folder that says component's just like that.

50
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,520
And now we're going to have three different components.

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,010
The paranoid one is going to be indexed.

52
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,880
And inside here you're going to have a header components.

53
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,090
It's going to be Hetter digest.

54
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:59,990
We're going to have a news item that is going to hold all the news so we can say news underscore and

55
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,880
list and you can name this files whatever you want.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,950
It's essentially up to you again to create a new file that is going to be news on the score list on

57
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,790
their score item dodgy.

58
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,430
Yes everything is genius.

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,960
Of course you look at me and make this a little bit smaller.

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,300
There we go because this one and I'm now just going to close all the components.

61
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,900
So the first component that we need to create is going to be the head or component.

62
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,770
So first I'm going to just delete this just like this.

63
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,110
And of course right here we can have a header and begin to begin to do it right.

64
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,950
Right now in a minute we're going to say DIVX and right here we can have the header.

65
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,050
Remember that when whenever we turn something we need to return everything wrapped into into it.

66
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,690
Inside one element.

67
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,650
So right here we can have a header of course just really simple.

68
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,270
And if you go get better.

69
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,100
That's good.

70
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,900
So now let's create the component for this.

71
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,680
Now again whenever you work would react since you're going to be using GSX and re-act code you need

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,840
to import re-act from react to the same thing we did right here.

73
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:20,600
So I'm going to go right here and get a say import react just like that with capital are from react.

74
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,410
If you don't do this and you want to use them some re-act code it's not going to work.

75
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,770
You to you can get an error message and that's it for now you're not going to be using the other one.

76
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,800
They react on the react.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,950
It's just to render something on the route says you're not going to do that.

78
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,470
You're just going to create the components and include it right here.

79
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,010
So we're going to create a components can be Konst just like we did with the other one.

80
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,020
This one is going to be called Hetter is going to be equal to is just a function that is going to return

81
00:05:51,020 --> 00:06:00,310
some code so I'm going to say return and begin to return a dev that says Hetter real simple.

82
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,460
Then of course we're going to be changing this.

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,510
OK so now we have our component.

84
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:14,720
Now we we need a way to connect all the components right now to the index which is depende one and the

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,320
header.

86
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,510
So we need to tie them together.

87
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,530
Now unless we connect them manually they are not related.

88
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,880
So to connect things to connect components with other components we need to make them available for

89
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,270
other components.

90
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,240
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and we're going to say export than default.

91
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,160
And then the name of the component that we want to share with other components.

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,150
So since our component calls Hetter we're going to say Hetter.

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,650
So now this component is going to be available from other pieces of code.

94
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,260
Now I'm going to save this one and we're going to begin to include that component to Hetter component

95
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,520
inside here inside the main components.

96
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,640
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to just add a comment.

97
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,500
I was going to say component's so right here we're going to have a list of all the components that we

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
need to include inside the main one the parent one.

99
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,000
So no how do we import that coat.

100
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,480
We're going to say import just like with this before import.

101
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,660
And then we need to put the name of what we want to import.

102
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,430
This case is going to be beheader so I'm going to say.

103
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:35,840
Now we say from now instead of doing Hetter just like with it right here since this is not a note module

104
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,040
is just one component from our application.

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,800
We need to specify the path I'm going to say Dot than then for Slash and access the components folder

106
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,820
for I-Slash and bring the header.

107
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,890
Now since Hetter it's already a javascript file there's no need to put the extension if you work with

108
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,050
VSS and we're going to be talking about that in a minute.

109
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,530
We need to use the extension.

110
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,500
But let's get.

111
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,370
So I'm going to save the application and check it right here.

112
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,730
So we going to get Hetter is defined but never used.

113
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:15,230
So it's whenever you have some code right here that you're not really using it's going to give you a

114
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,190
warning.

115
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,990
So it's considered bad coding having components that you're not really using.

116
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,260
Ok so now how do we include how do we use this Hetter component that we are importing from here.

117
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:36,020
So what we can do if I just copy this and it's happening right now and I paste it and since this is

118
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:42,680
a viral is not going to do anything is just outputting text because we are just using some text.

119
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:50,400
So just like we did before whenever we render the app we need a way to tell react to this component.

120
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,490
It's it's an actual component that we are importing.

121
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,110
So we need to enclose everything just like this.

122
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:05,540
So now re-act knows that whenever it needs to render this is going to check oh this is this one has

123
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,080
takk.

124
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,290
So this could be a component.

125
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,820
Let me check.

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,330
Yeah it is a component because we are importing it right here.

127
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,200
So if we save it we get Hetter just to make sure that we get something else.

128
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,840
We're going to say this is my new header.

129
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,880
And if I save it we get.

130
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,250
This is my new header.

131
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,420
So now we are exporting this component and we are just importing it right here and including the components

132
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,770
inside the parent components.

133
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,670
That's got you know it's working.

134
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,780
We're going to of course make a lot of changes right here to the header.

135
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,100
But for now I want to talk about something else.

136
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,320
So let's move forward to the next section.

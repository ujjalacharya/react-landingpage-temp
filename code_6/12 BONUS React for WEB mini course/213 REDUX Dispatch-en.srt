1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,790
OK so now we're going to see the proper way of using action.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,070
So whenever we want to trigger an action we're going to do it in a different way not this way.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,740
So whenever we trigger an action we say that we dispatch something we dispatch an action not trigger.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:24,150
So again that is the redux of lingo that we need to use whenever we we want to use an action we dispatch

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,470
it.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,030
OK.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,620
So how do we do it.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,070
OK so I'm going to go out the top.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,010
And as you notice we are importing all the actions from within this file.

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,220
So right here we're going to get all the functions we have right here but maybe in the future you're

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,740
going to have a lot of functions a lot of action creators and you just need to import this one.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,250
So in this case what I'm going to do.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm going to delete the actions and I'm going to use destructuring and I'm going to bring just this

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,620
one.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,270
OK.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,010
So I'm going to copy and paste.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,890
So now the application is going to fail because we don't have auctions anymore.

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,150
We have just one that is going to be called movers list.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,410
So now the proper way to this patch in action is just like doing map state prompts we have a different

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,790
way that it's going to be called map.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,730
This patch to prop's make sense.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,310
Yeah.

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,230
So we're going to say Consta and then map this patch just like this.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,180
And then two and then prompts.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:31,390
So this one is going to be just a function and just like we did with the maps that props this one received

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,280
state.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,540
This one is going to be receiving this patch just like this.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,090
So the main purpose of this map this patch to props is to return the actions.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,520
So first I'm going to copy the keyboard map this patched props and I'm going to be passing it right

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,960
here.

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,010
A second argument.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,910
So now the second thing we need to do is to return something inside the map state prompts.

33
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,810
This one is going to be returning whatever action we want to use in this case.

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,090
We want to use.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,280
We want to use it to use one that calls movies list.

36
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,820
So I'm going to copy the name and I'm going to paste it Frank right here.

37
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,990
This is an object.

38
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,550
So this move is list at the end.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,710
It's going to be just a function.

40
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,270
So whenever we trigger it we need to refer to this as a function.

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,170
So this is a key name right.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,170
So now this one is going to be equal to a function.

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,820
Open and Close.

44
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,350
Now this function is going to be using this this patch we have at the top and again is going to be a

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,080
function.

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,990
So what we pass is going to be the movies list that we have at the top.

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,230
It's not the same name.

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm using the same name.

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:40,690
I get it.

50
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,420
I'm going to change it.

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,050
I'm going to say get movies.

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,090
Makes more sense.

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,590
Get movies.

54
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,210
So whenever we triggered this get movies from within this that Probst is going to be using this.

55
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,560
You know it's going to be dispatching this movie's list that we are importing at the top.

56
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:07,230
So now instead of using this the props and movies list we used to get movies and we're going to get

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,770
the movies right.

58
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,220
So this is the proper way of this patch and in action.

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,410
Now the other one you should always use this one.

60
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,840
All right so there's a second way of doing this.

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,240
But for this I'm going to need to complicate things a little bit.

62
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,020
What happens if you have a second action creator.

63
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,410
So let's say get director's going to do that.

64
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,410
Just going to copy.

65
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,530
Going to go to index inactions actions are going to copy movies list and are going to say Directors

66
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,840
list right.

67
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Makes sense and for the time I got to change it to death list and payload.

68
00:03:45,930 --> 00:04:00,760
Tarantino mini me cried termer Encino Well you know and then I know a different director Scorsese Argo.

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,100
I don't know if this is the correct way to write this.

70
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,150
Maybe like this.

71
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,370
Whatever doesn't matter.

72
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,420
So we have two directors on the Directors list.

73
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,490
So now what we need to do we need to create to reduce her for this.

74
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:21,490
So I going to go to movies producer or get a copy to case we have on top to paste it down here.

75
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,280
We are using a different type.

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,250
So I'm going to just change it.

77
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,700
Copy and then paste it right down here.

78
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,140
Now we're going to be returning instead of movies directors.

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,930
Right.

80
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,670
So now our application is just rendering the movies what I want to do.

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,790
I want to bring this action creator Directors list inside the app components.

82
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,180
First I'm going to go right here to the Render I'm going to say console that block.

83
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,690
And then this stuff prompts to see what we're getting.

84
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,880
So I going to check in inside data.

85
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,990
We just get movies.

86
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,520
Now I'm going to go at the top and I'm going to bring the all the action creator which is going to be

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,720
director's list I'm going to paste it at the top.

88
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,520
OK.

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,490
So now we are still getting the same thing of course.

90
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,310
So now what do we need to do we need to trigger this director's list.

91
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,400
We need to dispatch this action again right here.

92
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,010
We only get we have to get movies.

93
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,640
But since this is an object if we want to add another action what we need to do is just create a different

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,820
scenario for this so it's going to be get directors just like this open and close and then we pass the

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,450
action and it's going to be again this patch open close and we get the directress list and we execute

96
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,410
this.

97
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:49,850
So now at the top if we do this that prompts and then it get I believe get directors we're going to

98
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,710
be getting that data and maps state to.

99
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,950
Is going to be listening for the state and inside the state inside data we're going to have the information.

100
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,670
So I'm going to save it open and close and inside data.

101
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,060
We have directors and we have movies.

102
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,660
So this is the again the main reason of why redux is so popular ones.

103
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,150
If you want to add something you want to add a function right here just an excellent reader.

104
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,260
You add it then the reducer and then you request it right here at the top.

105
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,300
And you know and you put it right here and that's it.

106
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,790
Then you get the data and it works really fine.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,390
Now there is a second way of doing this.

108
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,510
Now imagine that you have I don't know seven or maybe 10 or 15 actual creators and you need to use them

109
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,820
all.

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,790
What are you going to.

111
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,950
You can copy paste right here on the list of 15 times.

112
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,050
No it is not that fun to do this.

113
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,750
So we have a different way.

114
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,630
We have something that calls bind auction creators and bind auction creators.

115
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,250
It's from redux.

116
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,670
So I'm going to delete this for now.

117
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,410
Delete this to save it and I get it all of this.

118
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,360
So we don't get any mistakes.

119
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,400
So right here we are still importing the movie's list action creator and a direct just list.

120
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,300
That's good.

121
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,060
I'm going to bring something else that is going to be called import.

122
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,930
We use destructuring and we say bind bind.

123
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,360
And then action and then creators.

124
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,480
So bind.

125
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:31,430
Action creators is going to be Fromm redux a from and then redux.

126
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,800
So what does this bind auction creators do for us.

127
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:43,550
So with this one what we can do we Compounce all the actions we have on the top that all the actions

128
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,060
we are importing is going to just create all that functions.

129
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,780
Notationally we have right here.

130
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:58,760
So what we can do we first we do the Cong's and then map and then dispatch to prompts map map this patch

131
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:07,240
to prop's is going to be equal to we are still passing the dispatch just like this.

132
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,030
And then we just return a function.

133
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,190
So what we return is going to be the bind action creators.

134
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,540
This action creates this bind actually.

135
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,910
Creators is going to take two different arguments.

136
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,800
First is going to be an object with all your actions.

137
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,930
And the second one is going to be this dispatch.

138
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,560
So right here seems we have two actions what we could do we just copy the ones at the top and then just

139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,580
paste it inside.

140
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,540
And if I save it of course it is going to happen.

141
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,320
I need to make the request right here sorry.

142
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:50,560
So we going to make a call to this that prompts that prompts and then just the name of the of the action

143
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,020
creator and thats it.

144
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,360
Now let me copy the other one directorates list

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,900
the application is going to reload and we are still getting the same thing.

146
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,000
And inside data we were still getting directors and we are still getting movies.

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,650
Now the thing is about a bind and creators what he's doing is just creating all that logic for us.

148
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:18,850
And then at the end he's going to be passing to Matt this patch to Probst just the object with the same

149
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,740
key we had as in actions.

150
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,030
So this one is going to be equal to function.

151
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,350
And you know just this patch and that coma and we can have the director's list which is going to be

152
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,810
again a function.

153
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,640
And at the end is going to create all of this for us and it is going to be passing to match dispatch

154
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,450
Propst.

155
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,980
And then at the end begin to be able to access them as a key value pair.

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,250
Makes sense right.

157
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:49,480
So again if you have a lot of actions the other one is kind of a pain in the ass but if you have if

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,480
you want to use bind action creators that's going to be better no less typing right.

159
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,090
Lets get this looks nice.

160
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,830
So lets move forward to the next topic we're going to be talking about container's.

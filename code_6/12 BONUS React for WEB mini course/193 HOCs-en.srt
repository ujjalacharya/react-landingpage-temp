1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,160
Right.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,950
So now we're going to be talking about h o C's day.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,200
It stands for High or other components.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,200
So this is another topic that it sometimes is hard to understand by developers because most of the time

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,520
we don't understand where to use it or why using it.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,290
So I'm going to give you different different approaches are going to start with the easiest one.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,020
So I'm going to go to profiles non-jazz and inside profiles.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,240
If you go to profile of course is doing the direction.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,200
So I'm going to comment this out OK.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,760
So OK so we go to profile and we get take me to profile photos and everything is going to be tested

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,670
link.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,330
Let me just delete the reader.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,130
Rection good.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:51,710
So OK so now what happens if this link you know this content we have right here that say that this code

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,320
is going to be something that is going to be using the whole time in your application.

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,680
You can repeat this GSX inside post maybe inside home you can do this a lot.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,550
So we could use a high or other component just to try to show a template of this.

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,760
This is one way of using high or other components.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,660
So what are you going to do.

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,280
I'm going to go to components.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,740
I'm sorry to source.

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,540
I'm going to create a new folder that is going to be called a cease and right here going to create a

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,410
new file that is going to be called Card that jazz whatever it's going to you know I'm going to copy

24
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,370
the concept of home the template component.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,290
And this one is going to be called car and then we're going to call this one current.

26
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,150
OK.

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,000
Got it.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,890
That's good.

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,870
So now what this card it's returning it's going to be some diff.

30
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,480
But the thing is that what we want to do we want to call this to include this card component grab whatever

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,350
we have right here send that back to cart and then rendered that content inside that template that we

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,620
have right here.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,990
Now if you remember we could use the we could do this with prompts the children.

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,660
OK.

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:15,940
So first include the card component going to say import that card from open and close that for Slash.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,970
And we go back to H-how CS and we need to bring a card.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,210
So now this component the card component it's available inside profiles.

38
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:26,880
Good.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,230
OK.

40
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,410
So I'm going to go back to card and I get to create just desirable.

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,410
Can we just a marvel that you know we're going to be changing this style so it's out of style just to

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,100
you know just to check.

43
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,150
So I'm going to create a marvel that is going to be called style and there's one is going to be called

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,590
to background something simple background and light gray makes sense.

45
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,740
Light gray.

46
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:00,540
So now I'm going to go right here and say style then open and close and begin the same style.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,250
OK so now what I want to do whenever I want to render this is going to be rendered within this template.

48
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,840
And this is going to be wrapped inside the car and it's going to change the background to light gray.

49
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,510
So right here and getting this component is going to be receiving some props and right here since we

50
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,870
want to rent or whatever we are going to be passing from profiles we always rendered Probst that children

51
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,020
just like that.

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,320
So this one is ready.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,210
It's receiving some props.

54
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:40,190
It's returning a div and whatever contents we have inside props the children and we can have the background

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,740
of light gray.

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,010
So I got to go right here.

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,460
We are importing the cart so the only thing that I need to do right here I need to call this component

58
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,870
to use this component so I'm going to say cart and then just cart and everything is going to get rendered.

59
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,310
And we have the background of light gray.

60
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,620
So we're using this component as a high or there component of all the concepts we have right here.

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,200
So this is the very basic idea of a high or other component.

62
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,260
You know they're going to get a little bit difficult to understand begin to move forward right now to

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,650
the to the next topic which is a different way of using height or the components.

64
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,840
But this is the simplest way of a high or other component and you're going to be using again this the

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,830
whole time and we get when we hit the practice section of the course we're going to use this a lot because

66
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,850
we use it for pretty much everything.

67
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,510
OK.

68
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,920
So let's go to the let's go to the next approach of this.

69
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,460
OK so let's see a different approach of this.

70
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,560
Let's pretend that this profile section needs authentication.

71
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,330
So if the users have authenticated we want to let the user in if not begin to kick the user out or we

72
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,380
can you know just show an error an error message.

73
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,420
So we need to created high or other components to do this.

74
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,290
And I'm going to go right now to cosies and create a new file that is going to be called out just like

75
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,530
that.

76
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,140
So of course this is going to be just a component.

77
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,860
Just going to copy this and the markup and I'm going to call it off just like we did before.

78
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,510
No we're going to delete all of this for now we're just going to delete it.

79
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,230
And this one is going to this out it's going to receive some props.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,170
And the only thing that it's going to do is going to return prompts the children

81
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,940
for now which is going to do this is the only thing that we can do.

82
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:47,510
So now we're going to go to profiles and I'm going to put this off and say import than all of that from

83
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,650
and we do dot dot for Slash.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,280
H.O. sees forward slash.

85
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,560
And then we bring earth just like that.

86
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,570
And if you notice this is still working.

87
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,100
OK.

88
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,710
So we are not getting ours.

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,790
So now what I'm going to do I'm going to go right here and instead of doing dev I'm going to create

90
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:12,230
this out components and I'm going to wrap everything inside of it just like that.

91
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,780
There we go.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,010
And close.

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,280
So now note notice that again this again is still working.

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:28,580
So we're bringing elth which is a component that is going to receive send children the job of all is

95
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,600
just to return the children.

96
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,420
So OK.

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,040
It's going to go to the next step then cart is going to get some children and child and car to Jarvis's

98
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,740
of cart.

99
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,550
It's going to be wrapping everything inside a div with this style and then return the children.

100
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,300
And then of course we get the link.

101
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,970
So everything is in kind of a in the casks cascade style.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,450
So OK so now the job of off is not going to be just you know just returning the children begin to do

103
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,800
something else right here.

104
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,900
So the job of all that is going to be checking if the password is correct so I'm going to delete this

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,400
and get to make this a proper function.

106
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,450
So let's say that the user and of course we are pretending we're going to get to this part later.

107
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,100
This is going to get a lot more complex.

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,960
So let's say that whenever the user enters you're going to get something that it's password one two

109
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,840
three that's the password of the user right now.

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,220
So we're going to be doing an F and if else statement.

111
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:35,680
So if the user if the password of the user matches something we want to to let the user using if not

112
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,360
we are not going to let the user in.

113
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:45,010
So we're going to say if the past is going to be equal to you know password one two three if not begin

114
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,230
to do something else and then do the US.

115
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:47,830
OK.

116
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,980
So if the password is different than 1 2 3 what we want to do we want to return just an H-3 tax saying

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,830
you are not authorized something like that.

118
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,740
Now if the passport it's correct it which means that pass or one to three equals pass were one to three.

119
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:16,290
Of course we want to return and then prompts the children begin to move forward with that treat.

120
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,930
OK.

121
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,410
So this is going to reload and you know we get props that children if I add a number four for example

122
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,570
there's one are not going to be the same.

123
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,200
We're going to get you're not outthrust.

124
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,550
So what is happening right here.

125
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,970
Let's go again with whole process.

126
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,800
Including card which is an H O C an hour which is an oath.

127
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,230
OTOH Ozy.

128
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,200
So the first step is going to be going to the to the mouth component is going to be entering our component

129
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,570
and it's going to pass all the children's.

130
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,490
So off is going to check if the password it's correct or not is the password.

131
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,780
It's not correct.

132
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,390
Instead of returning all the children's which is going to be all of this code right here is going to

133
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,080
return just an H 3 task.

134
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,320
So the result of this instead of having this is going to be something like that.

135
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,320
So this is what we're getting right now.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,470
Now if the passport it's correct is going to move forward and return prompts the children.

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,130
OK.

138
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,730
So inside props the children what we have is going to be the cart.

139
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,830
Now the cart is going to pass whatever children we have inside cart.

140
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,760
Is going to do the same process is going at first.

141
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,980
I did have an inside did this is going to return the children.

142
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,770
So we get all of this.

143
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,560
So now the result is going to be something like that and of course then we have the the the rest of

144
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,560
the children which is going to be the link to final cut.

145
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,500
You know we get the same result.

146
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,020
Let me save this reload we get not authorized.

147
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,430
And if you go off and match the passports it's working OK.

148
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:03,570
So this off as an h o c it's pretty pretty common going to be using this when we reach the authorization.

149
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,650
The out part of the course is security going to be using an agency and we're going to be using again

150
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,220
overseas for a lot of things.

151
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,680
OK.

152
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,310
That's good you know make sense but we need to talk about something else.

153
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,660
I could have skipped this.

154
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:27,950
It's a kind of a different approach of HFCS and I'm going to tell you how this works because maybe you

155
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,020
inspect someone else's code.

156
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,860
You can find and find an see with this kind of weird syntax.

157
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,360
So let's go to the next section.

158
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,550
It's going to be a little bit long.

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,200
So let's go to the next section and I'm going to show you the.

160
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,160
Show you this weird HLC.

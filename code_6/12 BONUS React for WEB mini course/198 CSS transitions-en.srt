1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,960
Read so now we know that transmission uses a state to do the transitions says your sister incisions

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,820
follows the same idea.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,850
So I'm going to go to see our sister stations right here we get just a text so we're going to be needing

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,590
the same thing that with before the state and this show did function.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,130
So I'm going to copy all of this.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,910
Get a copy and then paste it right here.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,710
OK.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,980
I want to stay with the name but that's fine.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,380
Just leave it fade.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,000
OK.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,590
So what else do we do we need.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,740
We have to function.

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,360
And we're going to need the button that is going to be changing state.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,250
So I'm going to copy and delete CSSA decisions and pays the bottom of the bottom.

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,680
So you know we get it.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,130
So now we need to import and we going to import something else.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,740
It's going to be import and the name is going to be CSSA just like that Sia says all in caps.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,710
And then transmission.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,830
No it's different.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,210
And the other one the other one is called transition.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:02,940
OK.

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:12,050
So this one is going to be it's going to be from and then react dosh transmission and then group Burguet.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,220
Remember notice that right here we didn't have a forced slash just react rescissions group.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,190
So now just like with it before we need to wrap everything inside these elements.

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,780
So CSSA transmission opening close.

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,750
And for now I'm going to I'm going to just show a dip print a dip.

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,610
OK.

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,800
So we get hello and of course nothing else.

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,990
It's not working.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,120
So with transmission's what we get we get a function that has this state and then we use this date to

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,600
change the class names.

32
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,660
Now with the assistance missions.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,990
This one is going to be it's going to work kind of a different way there.

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,830
First we get the same options then before we have the end which is going to be equal to this state and

35
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,780
then show.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,910
And then of course we have the time out which is going to be five seconds.

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,230
I know it's a long time but it's going to make sense in a minute.

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,540
To put five seconds so the next option.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,440
And of course with this rescissions is going to be required is going to be called class names in asset

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,450
class names.

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
And notice that this one it's plural.

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,340
So with this one I'm going to be using a class that's going to I'm going to give it a class.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,920
So what your system is going to do is going to use this class to append the classes inside our dip and

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,640
it's going to do it for us.

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,350
There's no need to grab the state and do the class ourselves.

46
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,450
It's going to do it out medically.

47
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,960
So OK so this one is done I'm going to save and I'm going to go right here going to make a bigger of

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,670
course nothing is going to happen.

49
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,620
Going to do the inspect going to reload the page again and select that Hello.

50
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,220
So for now we don't have anything.

51
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,970
If I click it notice that we get square exit and it's quite exit active.

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,820
And then it's going to be deleting that.

53
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,020
So it's appending the classes for us.

54
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,640
And if I do show or click kind is going to do square enter and a square enter active.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,150
So this is the class that you're getting.

56
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,220
So the assistance sessions is grabbing this square class that we passed inside class names and it's

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,960
going to pan the square and it's going to add and the dash enter and the active as well.

58
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,740
You know it kind of makes sense can be confusing but it makes sense.

59
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:35,000
So now we have the state of when the element is entering or it's active while it's entering.

60
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,960
Now the thing is that we have a tiny problem whenever the we have the debt you want to reproduce the

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,940
same example right here.

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,810
We didn't have a class that is going to be saying that the dev it's red you know we get no class at

63
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,400
all.

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,670
So what we can do we can add a class name manually.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,590
It's going to be it's going to say class name.

66
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,320
It's going to be equal to something.

67
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,140
So first I'm going to be adding the class square and then I need to know when the element it's visible

68
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,020
or not.

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,830
If you notice right here after the transition is done it's going to be deleting the classes.

70
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,080
The state we didn't get anything.

71
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,600
So what I'm going to do we're going to make a reference of this text you know.

72
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,900
True or false is going to be this state that show.

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,760
So now when we reload the page the element is going to be right here and note notice that it's grabbing

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,910
the classes from this one from Square.

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,430
I'm going to go right here is going to say is square.

76
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,670
True.

77
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,230
So we have the classic square and we have true because the element is it's possible.

78
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,700
So if I click it is going to be adding the false and the square exit and the square exit active.

79
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,930
And then of course it goes back to square false.

80
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,760
So you know it's to working.

81
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,490
So of course right now nothing is happening.

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,630
You know you don't get a transition's because we will need to add the C Ss for this.

83
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,650
So let's go to AB That's the assess and start adding the transitions right here.

84
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,940
You know we have the square already so there's no need to add it so we can say Square and then I'm going

85
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:18,030
to be adding the false false and it's going to be a background of I don't know whatever color.

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,650
Let me do one two three and then three.

87
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,230
You know a nice orange and they're going to be adding the transform and the transform is going to be

88
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,840
translate X and then minus 100 percent just like that.

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,230
Then we have the square.

90
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:45,750
True it's going to be Doud square and then that true opening close and begin to be moving the dif to

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,170
the original decision.

92
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,910
So it's going to be translate X and then 0 percent.

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,660
And what else.

94
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,730
You know we are getting the state of square enter and then square are active.

95
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,260
So we can use these states to do something else.

96
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:12,420
So I'm going to say Square and then dash and tour and the dot and square dash enter dosh active and

97
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,100
this one going to be change the background to blue get the next one.

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,460
Again is the same idea is going to be the square that does exit dot and then square.

99
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,010
Same thing.

100
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,370
Everything is very repetitive except and then active.

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,720
And this one is going to be background over a..

102
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,830
Green good.

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
So in theory this again should be working.

104
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,310
Going to reload the page we get the rodef.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,380
If I click at an exit and notice that is using the exit and it's quite active and is changing to green

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,740
and then it's going to change the state falls.

107
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,610
If I click it again we get the green and it's changing to blue because we have the enter and the enter

108
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,230
active and when it's done it's going to be going to the original state.

109
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:07,690
Remember that we are using five seconds for all and are going to be changing this to two seconds.

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,140
It's going to be a little bit faster just a little bit faster.

111
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,140
Wait two seconds it's a lot of time.

112
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,610
So I'm going to show hide.

113
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,720
It's going to do it.

114
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,250
And if I click it again.

115
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,280
No it works.

116
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,650
All right.

117
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,390
So you know it's it's real simple since we know how this one works.

118
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,240
We know how this one is going to work as well.

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
I mean save it again.

120
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,500
OK.

121
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,440
So let's.

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,460
Let's move to the next video we're going to be talking about the transition's group and we're going

123
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,040
to be using this tiny little function.

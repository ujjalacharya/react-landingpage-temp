1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,990
OK since we don't expect for the user to be changing the Ural manually just like you are doing right

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,810
here changing to profile the posts or whatever we need to do something first.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,100
No you must be thinking Dude we need to add a link.

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm going to put a than a ref and whatever we want ad will react.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,530
This is not going to work.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,120
We cannot use an ailing ATAC just like that.

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:35,020
So what we need to use is we need to use a property that is going to give us a router is going to give

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,510
us a model that is going to be called Link.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,710
So this link is going to create a link.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,870
So I'm going to go right here inside the header and I'm going to say link now.

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,530
Open and close this link is going to take us to home.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,320
Now with each link we have a property that we need to use that is going to be too.

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,990
Now the two is going to be of course like the ref.

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,910
So it seems we want to go to home.

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,850
We're going to pass a four slash and we go to home so we are getting a link of home and it's taking

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,440
us.

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,200
OK.

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,820
So MacCready the other.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,400
All the.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,310
All the other links are going to go right here instead of home.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,940
It's going to be posts and of course we want to go to posts.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:27,110
And then of course we can have the profile and begin to say profile and then take us to profile.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,210
And at the end I'm going to add just a ruler just a line so we can split everything up.

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,160
OK.

25
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,210
So to get home we go to home.

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,390
If you go to posts it's taking us to posts profile profiles.

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,190
Everything works fine.

28
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,070
You're getting home inside profile.

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,060
Maybe I'd change it by mistake muse profile again profile profile.

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,380
So everything works as expected.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,330
Now with this link we have some additional options.

32
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,050
We can do some settings right here.

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,660
We can use them settings.

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,320
So I'm going to delete this route and instead of passing chess with a text string with double quotes

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,040
going to pass an object and then inside I'm going to pass an object.

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,050
So the first curly braces it's not an object.

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,010
Actually it's you're making reference that we want to use something from react and then inside of course

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,730
we pass a set of rules inside an object.

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,280
OK.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,800
So this right here the options are going to be the pathname a hash and a search.

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,090
I know that it doesn't make sense but it's going to make sense in a minute.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,470
I'm going to say hash and of course then search.

43
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,520
So the pathname is going to be equal to whatever we are using inside the two.

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,560
So it's going to be the actual route.

45
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,310
So it's going to be profiled.

46
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,510
OK.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,890
Now the second one the hash whenever we use around is going to take us to profile and it's going to

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,390
add at the end of the Al is going to add hash in this case let's say that I want to add.

49
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,150
I don't know.

50
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:08,440
Hash tag Francis whatever it's going to go at the end and paste it and just put it at the end.

51
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,940
You're going to say coma and then the search.

52
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,650
So the search is going to be just a crazy string.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:22,530
So if I do chest like this and say profile and that equal to true if we go right here to the profiles

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,480
your dating profile then the query string and at the end of the URL we get the hash tag.

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:36,370
So of course this is really useful but it depends on which that what you're building which kind of application

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,300
you're building.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,600
Maybe you can use search to pass properties between you or else since we are using re-active just a

58
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,620
single page job.

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,920
You're not going to use it that much but it's cool.

60
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,230
You know it's good to know that we have access to this.

61
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,640
OK.

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,620
So let's keep moving moving to the next thing.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:02,410
Now what I want to do I want to catch it say let's pretend that I am inside profile.

64
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,870
Let me just delete this for now.

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,050
Just delete it.

66
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,600
Just leave the pathname.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,690
OK.

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,950
So if I go to profile we go to profile.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,190
Now what I want to do I want to add a link inside of posts but this link should be taking me to slash

70
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,220
profile for Slash posts.

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,230
OK so let's pretend right here.

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,990
That said that I have a domain is going to be my awesome app outcome and I whenever I click this dad

73
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,720
is going to take me to user but I'm sorry to profile just like that.

74
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,540
Sorry.

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,620
Posts are going to use posts.

76
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:53,170
But since we are inside profile what I want this link to do is to take me to forward slash profile for

77
00:04:53,170 --> 00:05:01,170
Slash posts just like that one for the link to know that we are inside profile and instead of taking

78
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,270
me two posts just take me to profile for snatch posts.

79
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,920
We can do this by hand.

80
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,190
You know we need to do something kind of dynamic right here.

81
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,550
So OK so I'm going to go to profiles and first we're going to be using.

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,220
We're going to be using a link right here.

83
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,870
So whenever we need to use a link we need to bring re-act road or dom.

84
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,540
If not you're not going to be able to use it.

85
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,590
So I'm going to paste it and the only thing that we can be using from here from here the reground Dom

86
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,950
is going to be link.

87
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,330
So I get to copy paste and say link.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:44,480
So right here I'm going to create a link real simple link open close and then take me to forward slash

89
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,450
profile for Slash posts so I can know that this is clear.

90
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,530
OK so I'm going to say to open close and I'm going to say posts whatever.

91
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,640
Of course it's not going to happen.

92
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,190
If I click right here it's going to take me two posts.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,950
I don't want this.

94
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,800
I want to do something else.

95
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:13,160
Now whenever you use react to writer Dom Rianne router and you have the browser router this parent component's

96
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,790
is going to pass a set of options just like what you're using prompts.

97
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,750
Well same thing this browser router is going to give you some probs with all the information about the

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,260
routes and whatever you're using.

99
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,350
OK so if I go to profiles I'm going to catch that.

100
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,170
I'm going to catch the prompts and going to see props and they're going to cancel out the proms and

101
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,440
see what we get.

102
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:46,320
And sorry props I don't know why I say bedposts props but going to reload the page.

103
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,450
And of course going to have that check the console.

104
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:57,640
And of course there we go to profile and we have a history inside probs a location and a match.

105
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,550
So you know we have a lot of information inside the props whenever we use Riak router we have a lot

106
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,180
of things we can use.

107
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:14,960
So what I want to do I want to get a dynamic Eurail from here and you know we check prop's we have the

108
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,770
information right here we know that the path its profile.

109
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,080
So what we can do we can get the Euro dollar the you are l from there.

110
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,170
OK so I'm going to go right here and I'm going to pass a set of rules just like we did before with pathname

111
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:38,300
and I say pathname open close and the path for this one is going to be using tempera strengths open

112
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,970
close.

113
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,360
And what I want to get is going to be inside props inside match.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,700
Inside you are all going to go right here and going to say prompts that match dot you are l and then

115
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:59,630
whenever you get the parent directory which in this case is profile I want you to take me to posts.

116
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,150
So in this case we are always getting a dynamic Eurail you know dynamic directory.

117
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:11,090
If we use it this way whenever we are inside profile it's going to be profiled force posts and if we

118
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,650
are inside posts it's going to be for Slash post for Slash posts.

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,350
Ok so if we click this it's going to take us to profile and then post.

120
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,940
So that is working.

121
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,130
OK let's get let's talk.

122
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,460
Talk about something else right now.

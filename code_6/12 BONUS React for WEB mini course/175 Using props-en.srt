1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,680
OK so now we could be talking about props.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,360
But first I'm going to do a few things.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,240
I'm going to go to the header dodgiest and I'm going to delete the title state because we don't need

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,120
it to delete the cancel log.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,300
You're not going to eat it.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,720
And then we are going to delete the dips right here.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,880
And of course to cancel right here we're going to save it.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,750
And if I check it now everything works that's good.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,220
So now I'm going to go to index Yes and what I want to do I want to bring the news and went to bring

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,170
a file some Jason data that it's going to be the news.

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,030
Right here we're going to have the news.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:43,420
So first US Prosit project resource is said this section resource I've added a DVD.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,990
Jason so you can download it download the file and put it inside the source.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,810
We're going to be using it right now.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,690
So this DVD that Jason is going to contain just a few Jason data with and the title of which is going

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,060
to be the title of the news.

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,310
And then just to feed with some some larm Epsom.

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,380
So what are we going to do.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,260
We're going to fetch this DVD that Jason and then we can pass it to a different place so we can render

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,240
the news first.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,980
We need to fetch Jason.

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,920
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say import Jaison from.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,550
And then we bring it from Dodd forward slash D-B the Jason.

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:31,210
And remember that we are inside the source but so now this DVD that Dasen is going to be converted to

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,750
to an object.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,230
So what we can do.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,010
I'm going to say console log and we're going to say Jaison.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,320
And if we check it on the console we have the objects.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,190
So now what we need to do we need to grab all this information and pass it to the different component

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,960
which is going to be the news list.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,380
But first inside the up the app right here what I wanted to use is going to be a class based component.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,250
So this one it's a stateless functional component.

33
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,340
I went to change that.

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,370
So first I'm going to delete this.

35
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm going to say class and then it's going to have the same name and then extends just like we did before.

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,520
I'm doing this right now because now we know how a class based component works and that we can use state

37
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:25,280
so we can do it right now and extents and then components and open close are going to leave the console

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,330
to Jason and remember that whenever we use a class we can just return something.

39
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,150
We need to use the render method open close and then we put everything inside of this

40
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,020
OK I'm going to save it.

41
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,600
And of course nothing works component.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,780
It's not to find we're calling component right here but we're not bringing bringing the component from

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,910
react just like we did before.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,980
So you can just copy this and bring the component coma and then components.

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,620
And if we reload everything still works just fine right here.

46
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,220
Jason is defined but never used.

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,590
We're going to use it right now.

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,830
So what we need to do we need to pass this Jason data to a different component which is going to be

49
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,140
the news list.

50
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,410
We didn't have a component inside the news list.

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,650
So we're going to do it right now.

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm going to say import re-act from and then react of course.

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,230
And this is always the same motion you need to port something.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,950
So a good advice for me just I'm going to give you an advice right now.

55
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,000
It's going to be having a template or having some snippets because you're going to be typing this manually

56
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,800
every time you do a project.

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,510
I'm doing it right now because I'm giving you a course some explaining what to do.

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,860
So I need to type everything but in real life you can have snippets.

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,710
OK.

60
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,800
So we're going to create this component and this component for now is going to be a stateless component.

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,300
So I'm going to say Konst functional component and this.

62
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,520
This one is going to be called newsiest.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,300
So I'm going to say use list just like that.

64
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,380
And this way it's going to be equal.

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,870
It's going to be equal to a function Burguet.

66
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:16,240
So this one whenever we call this one is going to return some GSX and this GSX for now is just going

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,690
to be a dev with news list whatever.

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,240
So now we need to make this component available inside other components.

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,300
So if you remember we need to say export than default and then use list just like that.

70
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,180
OK.

71
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,270
So this component it's ready to be included inside all their components but first we need to call them.

72
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,600
So we're going to put a right here to say import import and then we're going to be importing news list

73
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,490
just like that.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,830
And then from and then we do DOD forward slash components for was slash and use list.

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,970
So now just like we did with Hetter if I include this news list right here use list and we close it.

76
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,070
In theory we should be getting useless.

77
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,800
And that's what we are getting.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,270
So this works just fine.

79
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,440
Now the thing is that I'm fetching a Jason right here.

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,980
And what I want to do whenever a fetch does Jason I want to store it inside the state of app.

81
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,960
You know this app.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,980
So OK so I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say state and the state is going to be equal to

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,280
an object.

84
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,760
So now I'm going to create a new property that is going to be news and use is going to be called to

85
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,490
day sign just like that Jay song.

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,280
Again if we do cancel the blog just to make sure that everything works council lock we have the Jason

87
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,870
and the news available inside the state of this app.

88
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:03,060
So we say does that state that new and in theory we should be getting the logs so we get it.

89
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,570
Let's get to.

90
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,100
Everything works fine.

91
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:12,660
Now the problem and it's the main point of this section is to pass the news to pass the Jasen to a different

92
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,620
component.

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,670
And in this case it's going to be useless.

94
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,780
So we need a way to pass this.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,780
And this is going to be called prompts and it's very important just like the state we can pass data

96
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,290
between components using props.

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,320
How can we do it.

98
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:35,730
Well first inside this reference to the components I'm going to say news and this could be whatever

99
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,770
you want it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,030
Could be could be news could be donkey.

101
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,290
You can you can do it whenever you want.

102
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,150
So I'm going to call it news because of course it makes sense.

103
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,650
I'm going to say news and then opening close curly braces.

104
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,460
So right here we need to specify what we need to pass to this component.

105
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,180
So what we need to pass is going to be does that state that news.

106
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,290
And let me make this smaller.

107
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,580
There's the state that news.

108
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,940
So this is going to pass the decent data to the news list.

109
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,380
So now inside the news list how can we catch this information.

110
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,130
Well this information is going to be passed to this component which is it's just a function inside the

111
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,120
arguments.

112
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:28,200
So whenever you create a component you have some information available called prompts just like that.

113
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,340
And it's and you get this prompts by default whenever you use react with any component any type of component

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,120
if you use a stateless component a functional component just like this.

115
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,330
You can get some props if you're going to use a class based component.

116
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,210
You're going to get some props too.

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
You always get the props.

118
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,730
That's the one of the key features of react.

119
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:57,690
So in theory if I go right here at the bottom and say console log and then counsel log whatever information

120
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:05,400
I have inside prompts just prompts and go right here I'm going to get it and notice that this one this

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,620
one is kind of different is giving me an object with some news.

122
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,210
And inside the news they use property.

123
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,540
I have my news good.

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,900
So you know you get a lot of information.

125
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,930
What happens if I want to pass something else.

126
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:25,790
Not just news what I can pass is say donkey and donkey just like that donkey.

127
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,860
And it's going to be equal to me whatever.

128
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,000
And then I get to go to news list and of course we get a new object from the consulate prompts an inside

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,690
probably have news and we have dunky So in theory what we can do since we have that information inside.

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:54,750
Probst I can say console log and then prompts and then instead of a user you can say donkey donkey.

131
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,760
So we get me OK no that's good.

132
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,380
It's really really awesome if you think about it.

133
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,820
We can do a lot of thanks for this.

134
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:09,820
We are just passing a lot of data and we can catch that that data inside prompts and right here of course

135
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,840
we can use this prompts that Dunky.

136
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,070
Let me go right here.

137
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,790
We use the curly braces and we make a reference to props and Dunky.

138
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,970
So if we go below the page we get me.

139
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,520
OK.

140
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,330
So you know really really really easy to use.

141
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,210
We pass props and then we use it.

142
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,380
So now what we need to do and begin to go to the next section right now we need to create some markup

143
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,340
for this.

144
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,870
Grab the props bring the news of course it's not going to happen right here because we have an object.

145
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,150
So it's not going to display it.

146
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,240
Objects are not valid as a react child.

147
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:57,460
You cannot pass some object inside the return Sunia the Jason the I'm sorry the object data is not valid.

148
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,050
GSX so I was going to give you a fat error message.

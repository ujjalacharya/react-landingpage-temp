1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,360
Right so now we're going to be using C Ss modules and this is going to be you are going to show you

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,530
what we can do and then I'm going to show you how to do it because this can be confusing.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,690
First I'm going to delete all the things that we have inside news item.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,190
We're not going to use Glenmore.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,250
So just going to go back to the previous state of things.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,680
So now what we can do after we do some set up what we would we could do is to import maybe a variable

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,110
just give it a name.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,850
I'm going to use classes you can use the styles or whatever it is that you want to use.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,590
And then from and what we're going to do.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,940
We're going to import the CSSA from the source folder just like here.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,320
So I'm going to be an Access dot dot for Slash then CSSA for Slash.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,220
And then of course it's going to be a stylus that assess.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,040
So I'm pretty much including this style sheet instead of this just like with a header.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,700
You know over here know it's a little bit different.

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,900
Right here we are importing the styles directly and right here we assign here we assign you know a name.

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,020
So now what we can do after we enable modules.

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,710
What we can do is just go to dev where we want to use the class and we can use class name and instead

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,850
of passing some text what we can do we can pass the class that we have inside styles the class for this

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,520
is going to be something like I don't know dot news item or something like that news item.

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,010
And for now I'm just going to say background and then just read something like that.

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,270
So now what we can do since we are importing right here were pack and we.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,870
They're going to compile everything and you're going to have access to that class inside classes and

23
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,290
then dot and use underscore item and it's going to go ahead.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,030
In the style right here.

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,900
Par's everything and just do it you know here.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,060
I know it sounds kind of confusing but it's going to be a little bit confusing.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,980
But it can show you how to do it and you will get it.

28
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,110
Now here's the downside.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,810
We need to do a lot of tweaking and whenever we choose to use this method the modules including the

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,540
module we cannot use this one.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,280
This one is not going to work.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,970
So you're going to see in a minute why.

33
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,230
So the first step is going to be enabling the SS modules using this method.

34
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,600
So we need to change the configuration of how or how our app is rendered.

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,260
And I'm talking about what happens inside create re-act app and web pack.

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,700
So you need to touch the configuration files.

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,410
So by default the configuration files inside our project are hidden from us.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,500
So we are not allowed to touch the files.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,500
This is by default with Create we act up but react gives you the control over this.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,400
We can run a command and have all the configuration files available.

41
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,830
Now here's a warning once you disabled the feature of Hanney having the folders hidden.

42
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,090
You cannot go back.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,600
So if you make a change on the configuration you make a mistake the application is going to break and

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,790
you cannot go back to a previous state.

45
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,490
You can add to it is not going to let you.

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,850
So if you make some changes.

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,930
Make sure that they are you're doing the right changes.

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,900
And if not are you going to have to just inspect what you change and just you know fix it.

49
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,380
So I would recommend to use version control just like get to save a branch would you default state of

50
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,050
your app.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,710
So if you make a mistake you can always go back.

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,680
All right.

53
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,290
So the first step to do this to enable and this is going to be in the package to Jason can go right

54
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,150
here right here you have the dependencies and this is what we care right now.

55
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:59,070
The scripts when we use NPM start it's creating the development server for us so you can see it on screen.

56
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:05,670
But then we have the build whenever we need to deploy the our application to production is going to

57
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,690
create a folder with all the required files.

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,220
You know the bundled non-jazz.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,880
So then we have the test begin to see the slitter.

60
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,430
And then we have eject.

61
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,870
What why what is it ject why.

62
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,360
No it looks like a dangerous name.

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:28,730
So with object what we can do is say to create re-act app to disable the hidden folders.

64
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,930
So it's going to give us back access to all the configuration files we're going to do it right now.

65
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:41,130
Remember to save something and get to save your project and get going to declare I'm going to say NPM

66
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,480
run.

67
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,820
Just like that.

68
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,660
It's going to take a little while.

69
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,470
And are you sure you want to eject.

70
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,020
This action is permanent.

71
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,730
So yeah we now going to say yes or no.

72
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,210
OK.

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,240
So now the package that Jason is going to change is going to show you right here all the he's got the

74
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,450
Create re-act app.

75
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,210
It's using that we didn't have access but now we do.

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,360
And of course we have a lot more logic right here.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,050
And notice that we don't have the eject so we didn't have we cannot do eject again.

78
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:14,790
OK.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,710
That's good.

80
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,490
So now let me show you right here.

81
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,270
You have the public you're going to have access to scripts you know source the same source.

82
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,660
But now right here we have a folder that's going to say Confect.

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,260
So this is the folder where all the configuration happens.

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,740
And right here we have a web pack and a web pack prod.

85
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,590
You know the dev and the prod.

86
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,470
So whenever we use NPM start he's going to use the configuration we have for web pack inside config

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,470
that dev.

88
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,620
But if we do the built MP and ram build it means that we begin to go to production.

89
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,710
So we're going to use this one this prodigy is going to use this configuration and not the dead.

90
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,810
So if we want to make some changes here we need to make it on both files.

91
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,180
Okay that's good.

92
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,420
So now we need to enable the modules right here in the wet pack.

93
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,610
So we're going to go to well-packed Web let me make a little of this a little bit bigger.

94
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,180
I'm going to keep scrolling down.

95
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,830
You can have a lot of configuration.

96
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,000
Really confusing.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,350
Whenever we hit the web pack configure it what pack section of this course.

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,560
This all this logic is going to start making sense.

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,950
Don't worry I'm going to keep scrolling down until you see something that says see SS inside test and

100
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,910
then see it says so right here we have the options.

101
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,310
So we need to add some extra features right here.

102
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,800
So what do we need to do.

103
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,950
We need to go right here and say modules and modules is going to be equal to true.

104
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:52,440
So now modules are available for our project but we need to add to to add an additional feature.

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,040
Now whenever these modules is working is going to create names over the classes.

106
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,600
So we need to specify which names are we going to be using.

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:08,940
So we're going to say local Just like that ident and then name all income case and right here I'm going

108
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,180
to do something we're.

109
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,020
So we're going to be saying is that we want to use the original name of that class and we want to add

110
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:23,700
an underscore underscore begin to use the local then underscore underscore and begin to be using a hash.

111
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,980
We make just trim this down.

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,500
So what we can say is hash and we need to pass which hash and begin to use base 64 and then Kong and

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,890
the number 5.

114
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,430
So this is pretty much omentum stake right here named local hash.

115
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,390
Let's get.

116
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,600
So this is going to convert the CSSA to.

117
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,470
So it can use it in the project.

118
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,800
Don't worry I know this doesn't make sense is going to make sense.

119
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,460
UNAMID B we can actually do it on screen.

120
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,610
So I got a copy of this and we're going to go to the Web config but not to death.

121
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,220
But the production we going to do the same thing.

122
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,680
We can find that the SS.

123
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,100
The images and then CSSA.

124
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,620
So if you notice we have some other options.

125
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,220
And this is because whenever the web hack it's creating the bundle and everything else we have more

126
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,760
options because it's going to create a minimized version of everything.

127
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,050
It's just compressing everything.

128
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,060
So it uses more options.

129
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,570
We don't need it for development so we can be a little bit faster because we don't really need it.

130
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:36,300
So after import loaders we're going to do this and are going to paste modules true and local IDN name

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,650
and the same thing we have inside that.

132
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,620
So no same options.

133
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,770
So this it's ready so we can use modules right now.

134
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:54,290
So I'm going to close the dev of the close Prod. and right here we are importing classes from CSSA styles.

135
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,730
So let me go right here.

136
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,980
Of course this is not working.

137
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm going to do NPM start we're going to start a development server all around so that it's done and

138
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,870
notice that some things are going to break.

139
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,240
So the logo is breaking and we didn't have an stylings right here.

140
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,400
OK.

141
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:23,550
So I'm going to go back to a news list item and we import the classes we assign a name from the C S.

142
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:29,440
So now again classis a news item and what we can do we can pass a name.

143
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,960
So I'm going to go styles.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We have a news item that's good and right here.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,090
Class name use items again which has the same name because I was using a different name.

146
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,590
If you go to the project it's going to reload and we have a background for this.

147
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,430
And notice the notation right here.

148
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,250
It's having that class putting it inside each element with styles underscore underscore.

149
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,010
This is the local and underscore underscore the hash.

150
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,140
And if we go to the head we have it right here.

151
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:07,500
You know it's just importing the CSSA and it's putting the same names describing that class changing

152
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,690
the name so it can match the one we have inside the element.

153
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,760
So this is the main idea of using modules you know it's really nice.

154
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,450
So again if we notice that right here the logo it's breaking.

155
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:26,940
So inside the head are not just we are importing this on a different way so we need to import classis

156
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,050
from and then you know from here we need to use the same methods inside our project.

157
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:40,360
Now right here you're using a logo and we are using the class for the header you're not using a class.

158
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,700
That's why it's not breaking.

159
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,550
It's giving us a background of blue because we're not using a class but logo it's breaking.

160
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,620
So we need to do the same thing we did with the Newsless item instead of passing class of Logo.

161
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,860
We need to pass an object that is going to be classes because we have it on top.

162
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,680
Classes dot and then logo.

163
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,410
And if we reload the page.

164
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,690
In theory should should be working.

165
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,750
So you know it's working.

166
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,440
All right.

167
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,920
You know that's good.

168
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:15,610
So I'm going to be adding rowboat so I'm going to be going to add some styles to this because it's really

169
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,430
really actually going to go to the index that HD mail is going to add a new phone sized new phone style

170
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,150
no font going to be adding Roboto.

171
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,540
You can skip this if you wish.

172
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,800
Doesn't matter.

173
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:34,360
And then of course in the body I'm going to be going to adding add fun style font style and then it's

174
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,370
going to be rebozo course.

175
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,790
Let me make this better.

176
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,470
And then we're botto and of course we're going to be adding some styles to news item.

177
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,450
We don't need a background.

178
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm going to add a panning of 20 pixels.

179
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,100
What else.

180
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,590
The same thing we did before.

181
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:58,200
Can add a box sizing just like that make it better.

182
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,970
Box izing and the box izing of course is going to be for their box and begin to be adding border bottom.

183
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,040
Sometimes when you switch between javascript and says you get confused with the cons and the coma because

184
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,050
you know this is not an object.

185
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:22,580
So we can use a bother Barnham and it's one pixel solid and the gray makes sense.

186
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,740
Never reload the page a bit at stake right here and see.

187
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,570
We go.

188
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,840
I was using like an object that was adding the single quotes.

189
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,510
So OK.

190
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,430
So right here we get the style.

191
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,830
So this is working beautifully.

192
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,400
So again you can choose whatever method you wish.

193
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,320
You can import it right here.

194
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,570
You can import it without the class just like with it on the header.

195
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,090
Or you can use modules.

196
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,830
This is up to you.

197
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,110
There is a world of discussion of which one we should use.

198
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,360
Some people support this module some other people support the link.

199
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,380
You know at the end of the day it doesn't really matter if this works for you and you're comfortable

200
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,340
using this method.

201
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,710
You know you should use it just go ahead and use it.

202
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
All right so let's go to the next section.

203
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,180
We're going to go back exit the CSSA world and go back to the Dow components and what you're going to

204
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,000
be doing going to be filtering the news.

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,220
Remember that right here we have an input and what we want to do I want to say for example I went to

206
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,690
look for react.

207
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,480
This is going to go to the parent components.

208
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,970
It's going to check all the titles and it's going to show only the the the documents right here the

209
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:42,450
news with the keyboard we act good so we can show this to for example and the other ones are going to

210
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,280
be hidden.

211
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,020
And of course we're going to be using States and everything else.

212
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,770
So let's go to the next section and start work working on the Filcher.

1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,860
Read so the next thing would be for us to add an action that it's going to be fetching for us it's going

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,290
to do an actual request for whatever we type here.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,910
You know we do a search.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,610
OK.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,130
We don't have an action for that.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,970
So we're going to go to actions and create a function that it's going to be doing that.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,550
So inside actions is going to be export and then function.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:30,530
And then the name of function is going to call it artist and then list whenever.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,410
Now the difference the difference with this with this one.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,480
Then the artists list all is that this one takes in arguments.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,880
We need to catch.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,260
We need to be we need to receive the keywords we are typing right here so whenever we read dispatches

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,570
section begin to be passing the keywords.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,760
So at the end there's one rich received an argument I'm going to call it keywords OK save it.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,820
Now this one works just like this one right.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,350
We do a request and then we pass the payload.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,800
And because I'm lazy I'm going to copy and paste it right here at the top.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,160
So this one is going to do next.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,520
Actually I was request to the same Ural to the same path but this one is going to be changing a little

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,240
bit.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,910
What we do we pass a Q and equal.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,560
This comes from Jason's server to make a search.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,410
We pass a Q An equal to whatever is that you want to search and the information we have it inside keywords.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,510
So I'm going to say key words.

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,090
So this one is going to do it's going to go promise and when they promise gets resolved it's going to

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,250
return to data just like this one.

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:37,690
Right.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,340
OK.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,440
So again we're going to be returning a type in a payload.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,970
So it's going to be return opening close type and then pay load.

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:58,840
Now the type for name again it could get artists just like the skins is an object we need to do in Tacoma

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,060
and then we passed the request actual request.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,840
So our action is ready.

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,420
We need to add a get artists to the reducers.

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,840
So let's go to Nichols's Let's go to artists reducers and add value readers are for this.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:25,020
So it's case opening close and again called Get and let me just make sure get artists OK.

37
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,210
So this one is going to return something.

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,190
And what is going to be returning is going to be the same thing than this one.

39
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,850
Why.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,510
Whenever the application loads this component does view graphs.

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,700
Whatever we have in the list of artists list whatever we have down here and renders everything then

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,890
whenever we want to change it we are changing the same list.

43
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,200
So this component is going to get We've rendered but we know with maybe one resoled or maybe two results

44
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,340
here.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,040
All right.

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,210
That's the main point.

47
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,700
We're using the same one.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,700
OK.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,750
So the reducer.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,460
It's ready.

51
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,730
So let's go to the home container and include the action so I'm going to copy the name of the action

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,710
artist list.

53
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,280
I'm going to put it on the top.

54
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,260
They're going to go at the bottom and include it in bind.

55
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,590
Action creators.

56
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,440
OK.

57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,860
So now how can we use it whenever we type something this search keywords and this dysfunction gets executed

58
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,770
right here.

59
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,860
So we're going to get the keyboard.

60
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,300
So all you can do instead of console law is to this to this petty action right here.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,650
So we're going to at this.

62
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:51,390
I'm going to say this that prompts dot and then artist list and this one of course receives a key note

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,860
which is the argument.

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,470
So if I save it and test that should be working.

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,840
So I'm going to say Hendrix and works.

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
You know we are getting everything.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,650
So if I delete it of course we're going to say Madonna and Madonna works.

68
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,280
Let's say cash.

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:07,920
OK.

70
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,550
So that works.

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,280
Now of course there's a lot of improvements we can do here.

72
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,700
If I delete everything it's fetching the whole database again this is how we are Jason's are works.

73
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,770
But what we can do instead of what we can do of course more checking right here we can check if the

74
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,780
value eats empty and triggered the list all again.

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,820
And you know it's going to bring just sex.

76
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,930
What else instead of just doing something whenever I type maybe two characters I could wait until I

77
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,030
get I don't know five characters or maybe three characters and then triggered search so we can do a

78
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,910
lot of improvements.

79
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,900
We're not going to spend time doing that because that is just javascript.

80
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,160
It's not of maybe re-act redux it's just javascript.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,050
So I'm going to leave that right you're not going to do it.

82
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,710
Beginner spend time on the final project not this one.

83
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,700
OK so everything's ready for the home.

84
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,060
So the next thing is going to be building this.

85
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,660
Modifying this this one.

86
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,000
Still using Jason's server is doing how request an actual request from the component will mount.

87
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,530
So we going to be changing all of all of this logic and adding we do source inactions of course.

88
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,820
So let's begin doing that.

89
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,860
OK so let's add redux to the artists list.

90
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,480
If I go to components and artists list we can see that we have I'm sorry to the artist that yes we have

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,980
again the same thing as home.

92
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,860
A caste based component with the doing the request or the component will mount and then we render the

93
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,560
template from this that state up artist real simple.

94
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,200
So we're going to do the same thing at home.

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,570
This one is going to be using RE redux.

96
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,030
So we need to promote this one to a container.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,640
I'm going to create a new file.

98
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,290
It's going to be called Artist underscore container.

99
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,490
Jack's got going to go back to artist copy all and then pasted down here.

100
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,240
Going to go back to artist and delete everything.

101
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,040
Yeah sorry for that.

102
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,020
So inside artist it's just going to make a reference to artists container just like with at home.

103
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:20,350
So if we import re-act from and then Riak what else we need to import the artist and then container

104
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,550
from that that forward slash container's forward slash artists container then we need to of course we

105
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,120
need to return function.

106
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,310
It's going to be called Artist equals to a function.

107
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:44,580
And this one we'll return opening close ups open it close and we we need to return artist container

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:55,000
right make sense than we export and default and we export artist not container just Arzt.

109
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,360
So this one should be working.

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,340
If I save it it's going to reload.

111
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,420
But it's not going to work.

112
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,970
It says cannot read properly.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Paramo of undefined and this is because artists container to make the request is searching for the program's

114
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,920
and the ID.

115
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,410
But since now this artist container is a child container it's a child component.

116
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,270
We don't have this information.

117
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,650
We have it in the parent but not on the child.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,660
So what we can do we can request the props.

119
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,480
Right.

120
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,560
And we can say dot dot dot props.

121
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,310
So now are just containers is going to receive whatever props artist has.

122
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,450
And that's why it's working.

123
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,670
We have the programs and ID available here.

124
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,390
OK everything's good.

125
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,150
Now we need to modify this to use redux.

126
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,720
But first we need to create the actions and the reducers we didn't have that.

127
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,210
So pretty much what are we going to be doing is just create an action that is going to be receiving

128
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,660
this ID.

129
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,550
OK.

130
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,950
And then of course there are going to be doing pretty much this.

131
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:05,560
So I'm going to go to actions and inside actions I'm going to create a new one.

132
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,330
It's going to be called export and then function.

133
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,570
And we're going to call it artist and then detail expense.

134
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,790
There's what is going to receive the argument of the ID.

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,940
And again Sims and Lacey are going to copy this and paste it down here.

136
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,390
Now again the request is going to be the same.

137
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,270
Your RL is going to be artist but this one is going to be changing it's going to change.

138
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,630
We're going to we will request for an ID a off and whatever we get as an argument.

139
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,400
Right.

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,890
So then it's going to return to promise and then the data.

141
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:48,660
So now the user instead of going to get Artest all is going to go to a different place so we say detail

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,110
right.

143
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,880
And we pass.

144
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:58,740
Whenever we get from that request we don't have this but this reducer So let's go to reducers and create

145
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:10,140
a new one is going to be case open opening close get Artest detail begin to return return and then we

146
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,480
pass that state coma.

147
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,270
And now we need to create a new one.

148
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,070
We are not going to use this one.

149
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,980
We want to do something else.

150
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:26,910
So I'm going to call it artist and then data and this artist data is going to be equal to action that

151
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,890
payload.

152
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,830
All right.

153
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,980
So now on leave after we trigger this action after we dispatched the section is going to go to the producer

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,420
and all the information we need for this artist is going to be inside artist and data artist data.

155
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,280
Right.

156
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,620
Just like with with the other ones I told you that we'd read us when you get the first one.

157
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,620
Everything else is just redundant.

158
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,790
Its pretty much the same you just change the ID and the name of the key.

159
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,720
Right.

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,020
OK so everything looks ready.

161
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,590
We have the action and we have the reducer.

162
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:04,250
So now we need to change this artist container to use redux around.

163
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,930
So what do we need to do first.

164
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:13,760
Is this going to be requesting importing all the the connect and the creators and everything else.

165
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:23,280
So I got to say import make it ride import and then connect is going to be from react and then redux

166
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,240
the next is the action.

167
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:35,220
So import and if we take a look at the actions the action calls artist detail so art is detail is going

168
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,180
to be from.

169
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:43,490
And then I believe its not that force and then actions but going to use mind action creators we get

170
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,790
to use a second one.

171
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:58,650
We can discuss this in a minute import and then bind action and then creators from redux that looks

172
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,480
nice.

173
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,080
So now we need to use the connect so I'm going to go right here at the bottom.

174
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,570
I'm going to delete this and we're going to start again.

175
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:13,200
It's going to be export then default and instead of exporting the actual component we export connect

176
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,280
begin to say no no because we didn't have the maps state and the map dispatch.

177
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,760
And we're going to be using the components This one calls artist and the parent component cold calls

178
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,580
artist as well so I'm going to I'm going to cut I'm going to change it to container.

179
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,580
OK.

180
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,260
So there we go.

181
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,510
So at least we should be getting something at least.

182
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,860
OK.

183
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,130
So everything is good.

184
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,240
Let's create the maps that props and dispatched the props.

185
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,410
So I'm going to save function map date too.

186
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,900
Props to all of you again redundant.

187
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,160
Everything is the same opening close and we say state.

188
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,080
Now the argument that map state prompts going to be using.

189
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,570
So of course this one is going to return something and it's going to return the artists.

190
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,400
It's going to be equal to star state DOT artists just the same thing with the home component.

191
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,550
OK.

192
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,160
Looks nice.

193
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,470
It's really this patch.

194
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,170
So I'm going to save function and then map this patch to props.

195
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,030
Let me make it right this patch too.

196
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,230
And then props open it close.

197
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,690
The argument is going to be this patch.

198
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,720
Right.

199
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,460
So we get to use bind action creators so we use return and then bind action creators.

200
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,570
The first argument is going to be whatever action we are importing at the top right.

201
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,300
And the second argument is going to be the actual dispatch.

202
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:56,580
If I save it nothing's going to happen of course but what we need do we need to use the maps state to

203
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,640
probs and get this patch to Propst down here.

204
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:08,830
Right mobs dispatched props and as a second argument right again everything looks nice now.

205
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,730
Right here this component is rendering whatever data we have on this that's data art.

206
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,520
So we're going to need to change this a lot.

207
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,820
But first I would like to check if the action works.

208
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,810
First I'm going to go to the render and I'm going to do console that blog.

209
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:30,520
And then this stuff prompts just a check for least we get this action on the prompts.

210
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,390
So if we check it we have match location.

211
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,140
We have our justi tell Let's get.

212
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,900
So we are getting the we are getting this.

213
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,000
So now what I'm going to do since I went to this patch to S..

214
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:49,240
I'm going to say this that prompts dot artist and then detail and what we are going to be passing is

215
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,740
going to be this that props that match that harams that ID.

216
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:03,940
So in theory in the console log we should be getting the artist right here we have artist artist data

217
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,530
and we get the artist data.

218
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,850
So everything works.

219
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,710
Everything works really nice.

220
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,920
And how easy was this was the same process then home.

221
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,580
And we are getting the data.

222
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,350
This is why redux is so popular again after you get the process.

223
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,520
Everything is the same.

224
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,220
Right.

225
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:20,950
OK.

226
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,990
So now we're going to need to change this component a lot to render this data we get from here.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,260
You know we are getting inside artist state data right now is rendering everything from state.

228
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:41,230
If I delete the state of course and delete the X-posts everything is going to fail because we don't

229
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,900
have state.

230
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,310
OK so let's see how to fix this.

231
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,810
All right so let's see how do I fix this problem.

232
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,060
Again the first time that the application loads we didn't really have an artist's.

233
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,620
We have it on the second time.

234
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,080
So we again we need to do the same thing at home.

235
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,330
We need to check if this data exists.

236
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,180
And if it exists we wonder if we're under said this.

237
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,270
If not you're not going to run anything.

238
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,690
So first I'm going to delete this.

239
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
You're not going to use it.

240
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,490
We're going to host the template inside of a function.

241
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,730
So I'm going to say artist and then template just like this.

242
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,010
Open and close.

243
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,770
We're going to say we're going to be receiving some data and then we can of course do something.

244
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,840
So what we're going to be checking we're going to be checking if data inside data we have something

245
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,940
that cold calls artist data which is you know the information we need.

246
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,690
The one we have on the actual producer is data.

247
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:42,690
So I'm going to say data dot and then artist and then data is available.

248
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,720
We want to do something.

249
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,970
If not we do know.

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,420
All right.

251
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,390
So get to put it right here.

252
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,620
I get to go to the template right here.

253
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,050
Copy all can to cut it and paste it in.

254
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:02,090
Inside of here if you select this and make right click and then form selection is going to pretty fine

255
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,340
everything.

256
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,730
So this looks nice.

257
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,790
If we have data inside artists that data this is going to get Brender right.

258
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,280
So now we need to make a reference to this function.

259
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,520
And of course pass the information we have in this the prop's that artist remember that all the information

260
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
is inside of here.

261
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,990
So I'm going to say open it close and then this dot and we make a reference to this function artist's

262
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,340
template.

263
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,880
So it's going to be artist template.

264
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,660
And what we will pass is going to be whatever information we have inside artist.

265
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,210
This props then artists right.

266
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,790
Same thing we have here.

267
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,010
Now this one is not going to work because re-act doesn't like this.

268
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,210
We need to do we need to wrap everything inside of a div.

269
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:52,190
OK so now we're going to make reference to this template and we have a different message.

270
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,750
We're passing this the props that artist the first time that this Lote's this that processed artist

271
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,990
and artist data.

272
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,320
It's going to be empty art stated doesn't exist.

273
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,530
So nothing is going to happen the second time.

274
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,160
Artist data is going to be avail for us.

275
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,380
But right here inside of this template we are making of reference to artists so artists doesn't exist.

276
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:23,040
What exists is going to be Deda dot artist data.

277
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,440
And remember this is not an array of objects is just one.

278
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,810
So we're going to do this.

279
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,900
We can do zero to access the first the first object.

280
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,570
All right.

281
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,590
So I'm going to copy data.

282
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm going to copy this paste it right here whenever we get artists.

283
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,680
So artist artist albums artists albums everything is good.

284
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,770
Right.

285
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,820
So now the application will reload.

286
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,190
And we have a different plan right here.

287
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,040
We are returning just to function.

288
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,680
We are not returning some GSX so I'm going to remove the curly braces again to go right here at the

289
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,870
bottom and change it for a print and print piece.

290
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,010
And now the application is going to reload and we get the information.

291
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,460
Everything works just like before.

292
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,750
So everything works really cool.

293
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,910
I'm going to show you a different problem.

294
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,590
Maybe it just let me double check maybe you have time maybe get time maybe not.

295
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,880
OK.

296
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:28,140
So I'm going to go right here to the network tap and when we make it open open open it I'm going to

297
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,430
go back to home.

298
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,260
Going to reload the application and now right here I'm going to make the application slow.

299
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,220
I'm going to put up faster G.

300
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,780
Is it still slow for us.

301
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,990
I'm going to click and Jimi Hendrix is going to go.

302
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,190
You see the white page.

303
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,150
And then it's going to of course show Shumi Hendrix going to go back home.

304
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,650
I'm going to click Madona.

305
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,100
You see Jimi Hendrix and then you see Madona.

306
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,200
The thing the problem is that on the previous has stayed right here on the Get artist detail since the

307
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:06,050
first time you clicked on the on an artist the information of Hendrix is going to be before the application

308
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,890
app updates everything with the Madona information.

309
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,730
That's why whenever you enter a new artist first you're going to get the old information until the action

310
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,450
gets triggered gets the information from Jason's server and updates the story.

311
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,960
So if a click cache we see Madona and then we see cache.

312
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,890
So we have that problem.

313
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,020
This is the last thing we're going to do.

314
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,270
So let's go to the next section is going to be real small.

315
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,050
Right.

316
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,550
But just go to the next section and fix fix this problem.

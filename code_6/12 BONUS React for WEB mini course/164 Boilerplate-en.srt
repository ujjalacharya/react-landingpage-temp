1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,350
OK so we can start simple.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,490
First we will learn the easy way.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,430
And as we advance we are going to move forward to the Pro way.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,630
So re-act provides us a re-act boilerplate.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:22,150
So with this we have everything set up for us so we can download as I trigger some commands and presto

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,600
we have to react.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,630
We get our re-act application.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,170
So of course this is going to be just the minimal template.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,230
But first to do this we need to install the seat eye globally.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:39,820
So whenever we install a global things in our computer then we can trigger and access this package from

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,180
anywhere in our computer we can access and use it for any project inside our computer.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,070
That's why we make it global.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,200
So first we will need to install this.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:54,910
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say and PM and it doesn't I'm navigated to my project

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,420
but right now it does matter.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,160
Just open the terminal and then go over here.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,710
If you're on a Windows computer you can type ACMD and it's going to give you the command line.

18
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,430
So I'm going to go right here and say install space and we can say mine is G.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,760
Whenever we use minus g it means global.

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:23,920
And then we're going to do create hyphen re-act hyphen app press center and it's going to take a couple

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,440
minutes.

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,040
Depends on your connection and your computer are going to pause the BDO and be right back.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,400
OK so everything is installed.

24
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,080
So I'm going to go to the command line.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm going to say clear.

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,390
And now notice again that I am inside the project.

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,690
I've navigated to one re-act basics and this folder is going to be the one that is going to go to you

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,440
inside.

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,370
Get help so you can.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,030
You're going to be able to download this folder.

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,730
And right here inside the Via the Visual Studio code I am already inside that folder.

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,800
So now how do we install.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,440
How do we create a boiler plate right here.

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:07,680
So I'm going to go to the terminal and I'm going to say create hyphen re-act hyphen app just like that.

35
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:14,680
Now if we do space and we type a name to something like my awesome app something like that whatever

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,780
this react is going to create a whole boilerplate inside this folder.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,510
So it's going to go right here.

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,680
Create a new folder and inside that folder is going to put all the files for the for our project.

39
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,620
I don't want to do that.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,610
I'm already inside the folder inside the command and inside the studio code.

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,330
So what I'm going to do I'm going to delete everything and I'm going to say that space and that whenever

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,630
you use Dudd is going to install all the files inside that folder.

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,700
So OK I'm going to press Enter.

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,640
He's going to take again a couple of minutes and I'll be right back.

45
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,960
And for Windows users and for Mac users why not.

46
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,970
If you didn't like to use the terminal this terminal where you can do the visual studio code once you're

47
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,770
inside the project you can you have access to an integrate terminal.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
If I click right here it's going to give you the terminal and you're already inside that project so

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,400
you don't need to navigate.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,290
You can use this one if you like.

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,170
OK.

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,410
So I'm going to go right here to the terminal.

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,430
I'm going to press enter and it's going to take a few minutes.

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,200
So I'll pass the BDO and be right back.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,090
OK so everything is installed.

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,190
And be sure that it's giving you some commands.

57
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,590
I'd just clear them up.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,180
Don't worry you're going to be using them later and right here we're going to have all the project structure

59
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,180
the power source and everything else is going to be talking this in a minute.

60
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,980
But how can we test if the application works or not.

61
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,610
So I'm going to go to the terminal and we need to be inside the project always inside the project and

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,420
we're going to say NPM start going to press center.

63
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,470
It's going to open the browser but I don't want it right now.

64
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,690
And it says startingly will have been server compile successfully and then is going to give you some

65
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,710
suggestions of an address of a location.

66
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,080
And if I copy this one to local and go right here and pasted of course we're working right here is going

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,200
to give us the application the welcome to react and this it's our actual project right here we have

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,910
a file that is going to be the index for this and we can modify it and it's going to modify it right

69
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,530
here.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
So whenever we use create react.

71
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,700
Everything is ready for us.

72
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,910
You know we can just start changing things and that's it.

73
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,080
There is no need to manually install everything.

74
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,860
Now this course is going to be a full stack of course.

75
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,890
So if we do create re-act app it wouldn't be a very good course.

76
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,190
So there is there are a lot of things happening behind this.

77
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,080
It's using web mail web PAC for example.

78
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,300
And you know we need to learn about web pack and we're going to do it later.

79
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,040
It's going to be going to go from right from the start with web pack and we're going to do all this

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,770
process everything that is happening with Create we act up are going to teach you how to do it manually

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,570
install everything manually but that's going to happen later.

82
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,310
For now to learn react we're going to be using the Create we act app.

83
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,190
Let's get.

84
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,370
So I hope that everything it's working for you if you have a problem you just can leave a comment on

85
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,040
the Q&amp;A and I will answer as soon as possible.

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,280
Let's go to the next section and start with Dr..

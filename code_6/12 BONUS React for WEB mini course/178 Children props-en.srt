1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,570
OK so now I want to talk about something that is small but it could be really really useful.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,360
So right here we have only three different components.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,970
I'm sorry four components the index the news list and this list it's calling the news list item.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,850
So now I'm going to do this I'm going to just code something and then I can explain you what's going

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,640
on.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,730
I'm going to this.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,760
This was the news list right here.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,910
It's a self-closing tack.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,340
I'm not going to do this.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,440
I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to say Newsless I'm not going to pass a self-closing

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,890
task any longer and a reload that will reload us.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,030
So it's loading again.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,530
You know we get the same result.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,540
It's still going to work.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,220
OK.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,820
So now what I'm going to do I'm going to say hello dudes whatever some passing a text and putting a

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,040
text inside the news list.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,940
And if we checked right here we don't have that text.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,230
So whenever we call this component we are passing some props right here.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:09,300
So whenever whatever information we put inside here you know inside the TAC is going to be passed as

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,890
props as well.

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,410
So if I go right here of course we didn't have access to that information because we are not calling

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:16,830
it.

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,120
But if I go right here at the top and say prompts I make reference to this prompts right here and I'm

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,760
going to say Dot and I'm going to use a very special keyword.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,550
It's a reserved key word is going to be children.

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,840
And we go right here at the top case loading it's a little bit slow.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,530
Wait for it.

29
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,670
OK there we go.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,140
So now you're getting.

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,270
Hello doods.

32
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,710
OK.

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,300
So this works.

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,170
Whatever information we put inside the tag it's going to be passed as Probst.

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,760
And then children and this is just some dumb text that we can put whatever we wish we can put.

36
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,430
For example an H3 taxation the news are whatever.

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,150
And then of course this is going to be passed as props right here.

38
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,810
And we are accessing through prop's the children you can put whatever color you like.

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,350
This can be like a thousand cold thousand lines of code doesn't matter it's going to still be passed

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,340
as props.

41
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,680
And even though you're passing attack like H3 or dev it's not going to be rendered as text.

42
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,530
It's going to be rendered as an actual death in this case an actual three tag.

43
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,160
OK.

44
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,290
So you can have these access to props children.

45
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,800
It's a really small feature but you know it could be really really handy.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,260
And one more thing before we go to the next thing.

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,960
Why are we doing this.

48
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:54,650
Why are we passing this news item when we were just doing the GSX right here from with the map we are

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,580
in Boeken we are creating more code and doing a news item to render that data.

50
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,390
But it was working right here with the map.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,760
Why are we doing this.

52
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,260
Well this is modular javascript.

53
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,180
This is the main idea of doing this.

54
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,170
You always need to chop everything into a single piece of code because then it's going to be easier

55
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,710
to work with.

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,650
Let's assume that this application is going to get a lot lot bigger.

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,020
So you're going to have tons of Marvel's tons of functions doing something something different right

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,640
here.

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,730
So maybe in the future you just need to modify something real slim inside each item.

60
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,460
So you're going to need to if you're going to need to look after this file look all the functions find

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,700
the one that's returning that data and then make diea change make that modification.

62
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:52,280
But in this case you know that you have an item on each news and then you can go to this element that

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,950
is going to have just a few lines of code and you can make the make the change make the adjustment.

64
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,560
OK that's good.

65
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,800
That's enough for now.

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,030
We're going to move forward to the next section and we're going to be talking a little bit more about

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,540
styles.

68
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,780
We're going to extend our knowledge about styles and of course we can style this because it's really

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,190
really fugly.

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,790
Let's go to the next section.

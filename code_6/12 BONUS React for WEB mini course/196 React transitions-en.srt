1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,730
Write so now you'll learn about transitions.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,070
I've made a tiny template so we can start with this and not to lose any time in building a simple template.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,830
So we still have a lot of things to learn so we're going to do a lot of coding in this section and it's

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,980
going to look weird at the beginning.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,420
So first you will need to download this template.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,140
This project I'm going to be adding this project as a download source inside the course inside this

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,790
section so download it.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,480
Put it on a folder and then of course you need to go to the terminal navigate and do NPM start.

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,210
OK.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,850
You just download that and do that.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,450
So first let me show you what we get on this template.

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,780
We have three different routes one transitions CSSA incisions and transitions group.

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,610
If I go to transition's which is this one you know you're not getting anything just a div with the text.

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,280
Same thing with CSSA rescissions and inside incisions group.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,320
We have kind of a function that it's going to be adding an element with a random number.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,880
Every time we add elements that that's it.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,530
And if Of course I add more I get more random numbers.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,750
If I do we move is going to be we moving.

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,760
Real simple.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,640
Now the main point of this is going to be to animate each and each enter on each dip.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,330
No that's the idea.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,500
So first we need to start with transitions is going to be the hardest one.

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,690
You know it's going to be the hardest one to do.

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:32,330
So we're going to start with that one because we know how to do transition we will know how to do all

25
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,270
the other ones.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,530
OK so first the first thing we need to do is to add a div and then a button that is going to be adding

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,220
a div right here.

28
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,170
So OK I'm going to go to transition's and inside here going to delete transmission's and inside I'm

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,650
going to create new div just like that.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,440
They're going to be adding some style.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,090
Real simple.

32
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,500
Open and close and then open and close again to add a background so we can see good background.

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,440
And it's going to be read just like that.

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,910
Oh read.

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:09,420
And then of course I can add height just like that hide and it's going to be I don't know 100 pixels

36
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,160
sounds right.

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,320
That's fine.

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,840
Now there's not going to be anything inside.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,490
At least we get the read.

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,090
That's what we want to do.

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,800
So to show or hide this element we need to state that it's going to be deciding if we want to show this

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,690
or not.

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,510
So I need to go right here at the top at the top and I'm going to say state it's going to be equal to.

44
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,000
And of course we add state and the state is going to be a show make sense.

45
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,740
And first it's going to be a boolean and it's going to be good.

46
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,960
So now to use the state to show the stev or not what we could do we can wrap everything in curly braces

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,840
and we can use a turn or operator to do this.

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,620
So that's going to be this that state that Schu just something like that.

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,250
And if states true this is going to be rendered and if not of course we will return.

50
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,750
No something like that makes sense.

51
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,260
OK.

52
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,790
So of course we have to.

53
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,260
It's going to be showing this.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,210
But if we change it to false.

55
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,640
No it's not going to show it.

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,970
OK.

57
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,730
That's good.

58
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,810
So now let's keep moving forward.

59
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,200
The next thing that we will need to do have to get is going to be a button that it's going to be displaying

60
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,960
this.

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,860
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and go right here.

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,080
Up first I'm going to tweet the function that is going to be tackling this state.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,280
So if we click a button it's going to change this state to false or true.

64
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,630
And this is going to be rendered or not make sense.

65
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,010
It's not going to create mine is going to be show deaf.

66
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,300
You can call your function whatever you want.

67
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,290
Doesn't matter.

68
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,540
And then of course we're going to open and close.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,590
So whenever I click it I invoke this function I'm going to be going to be changing the state is going

70
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,310
to be set state.

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,870
So it like that resemble and inside of course we want to change the state of show.

72
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,340
And of course if we click it and the state is false We're going to change it to true.

73
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,730
And if it's true we want to change it to false.

74
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,120
So what we do again is going to be a turnaround OPERATOR We're going to use ternary a lot.

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:25,170
So it's going to be if not this does that state that show we went to true and if not of course we Wonderfalls

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,680
get you go.

77
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,510
So now we need to add the button that is going to be the bottom for this.

78
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,610
It's going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to say Dave just just a.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,680
And this is going to say show or hide whatever doesn't matter.

80
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,400
OK.

81
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,870
I'm going to say.

82
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:52,830
Class name can add a class name or show of show something like that.

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,810
OK.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,730
I'm going to add an unclick just like we did before.

85
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,780
You know with the with the events.

86
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,090
Same idea and this one is going to be this.

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,970
That show did something like that.

88
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,910
We're going to invoke that function.

89
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,610
So it's going to be show live.

90
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,420
OK.

91
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,100
So we don't have this class.

92
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,250
But inside the abseil says it's going to be right here right here.

93
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,880
I've added that just previous Kersley.

94
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,590
OK.

95
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,040
So if I save it and go to the project we have the button show or hide.

96
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,380
And if I click it it's going to be showing the red death.

97
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,250
And if I click it is going to hide it just changed it to states.

98
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,100
And when the application renders is going to be displaying the death or not so it is working.

99
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,850
That's good.

100
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,610
So now would we want to do we want to add a nice transmission to this maybe a slide or a fade or whatever.

101
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,230
So first we're going to need to install a dependency for this.

102
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,450
It's going to be called react transmission's reactive decisions.

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,610
So are going to do Control-C to clear the terminal.

104
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,420
They're going to be installing this.

105
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,570
So it's going to be NPM install and then react.

106
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,870
Dash transmission let me make this bigger just like that.

107
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,690
Write react transmission's and then group and of course don't forget to do the minus minus say I've

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,100
got to stand and are going to pause and be right back.

109
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,700
OK so everything is installed.

110
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,720
So since we install then component a dispensing what we need to do is we need to invoke that dependency.

111
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,560
So first we're going to say import and then this import is going to look a little bit weird.

112
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,670
You know it's going to be a little long.

113
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,290
So we're going to say import and then it's going to be transmission just like that.

114
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,310
And it's going to be from and then it's going to be a little bit long it's going to be re-act transmission

115
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:58,610
dash group just like that and then forward slash and then transmission and know you should have a snippet

116
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,630
for this.

117
00:06:59,630 --> 00:06:59,890
OK.

118
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,790
That's good.

119
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,330
So we are importing transmission right here.

120
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,420
What we need to do we need to use it inside the return.

121
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,890
So I'm going to delete all of those.

122
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,030
You're not going to use it.

123
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,430
And of course I'm going to say transmission just like that.

124
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,070
And then I'm going to create a task we need to wrap everything inside the transmission tag.

125
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,640
No this transition is going to be using two main props.

126
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,420
The first one is going to be called.

127
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,990
And just like that.

128
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,630
And the second one is going to be called timeout equal to something.

129
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,020
So that in is going to be kind of the state of this transition component.

130
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:43,640
So we have a state right here that it's deciding if we want to show or hide it to change it to true

131
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,710
what we can do.

132
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,270
We can use this state.

133
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,380
So this one could be true could be false could be whatever it is we have it on the state.

134
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,340
I got to say this that stayed that show.

135
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,210
OK.

136
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,880
So this since this transition is going to be of course a transition we need a timeout we need to decide

137
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,670
how long the transition is going to take.

138
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,130
So I'm going to say two seconds.

139
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,690
You know so we can we can see the difference.

140
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,310
So we have the state of this Ellen decision and the timeout.

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,180
So I'm going to go right here and if I do something like that may be a tag that is going to say hello

142
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,720
just like that.

143
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,180
Going to reload.

144
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,580
And of course you know we get this do we get the halo.

145
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,550
But this one with transition.

146
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,050
It's not going to work this transition.

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,560
What it will return is going to be a function.

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,330
So are going to wrap everything inside curly braces and this function that transition is going to return

149
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,360
is going to have a state and that this is really important for us.

150
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,110
Now after we get the state is going to return whatever element we want to return in this case is going

151
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,460
to be a p tag if I go right here.

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
You're still getting halo so you know it's still working.

153
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,340
Now the funny thing is the state.

154
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,890
Why do we get the state right here.

155
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,890
Going to just output whatever information we get on the state just like that.

156
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,690
We're just printing this state and I go right here.

157
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,830
You know we get entered.

158
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:21,900
Let me make this a little bit bigger when we go right here and there we go.

159
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,060
So we get enter and when we load the application we get entered.

160
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,680
OK.

161
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,780
So I'm going to click.

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,500
It's going to say exiting and then exit.

163
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,860
And if I click again is going to be showing the data again in theory and is going to say entering and

164
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,810
then entered.

165
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,030
So what is happening right here.

166
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,190
So what we get with transmission and with the with this module which we acquisitions group it's not

167
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,420
DIAK The animation itself.

168
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:55,070
We're going to get a state so we can do the animations with CSSA or with whatever you want.

169
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,300
So in this case we get the state of what is happening with this dev or what should happen with this.

170
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,260
So we have.

171
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,700
And so when we click again it's going to say a thing and then exit.

172
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,840
So exit thing is going to be the Whenever the div is doing the transition and whenever it's done it's

173
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,450
going to be after two seconds we get a different class which is going to be at a different state.

174
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:25,250
And if I click again you know if it is this the state of this is going to be exit the div it's not it's

175
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,240
not there anymore.

176
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,750
It's going to it's not visible.

177
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,550
I click show is going to be doing the animation and then the animation complete.

178
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,860
Since we are getting the state what we can do we create we can create four or maybe two different CSSA

179
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,430
classes and you know just give it a class of or with the passively or with whatever we want with the

180
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,660
animation.

181
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,590
So OK let's go.

182
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,410
You know we're going to do it right now.

183
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,060
I know that it's kind of confusing.

184
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,870
It's not going to make sense.

185
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,660
But right now we're going to show you a practical example with a with a div and it's going to make sense.

186
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,940
So I'm going to delete this.

187
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm going to delete that P-TECH and instead of returning a P are going to return a.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,690
So I'm going to say div open and close resample are going to add style right here.

189
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,390
I'm going to add an inline style so we can see what's going on with this and open and close and then

190
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,140
open and close.

191
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,590
You remember that for inline styling we need two curly braces right here at the bottom and first are

192
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:31,580
going to be adding the same background with it before the read that Acoma are going to add height and

193
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,070
the height is going to be 100 pixels than coma.

194
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:43,780
And this one is kind of important going to say transition and begin to add the East for all all it's

195
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,420
going to be two seconds because we have the time out and this is going to be important if you're using

196
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,180
CSSA for the transitions.

197
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,440
If you put two seconds this one needs to match with whatever timeout you have right here.

198
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,260
If they are different you know you can have a tiny crawl is going to still do the animation but they're

199
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,770
not going to be synchronized.

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,280
OK.

201
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,380
So we are going to be animating whatever whatever we want.

202
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,380
So I'm going to say coma.

203
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,780
And what I'm going to be animating it's going to be the passing is something simple.

204
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,770
It's going to be state and.

205
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,140
OK.

206
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,370
Let me get started.

207
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,630
I'm going to say opacity.

208
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,120
What I want to do I want to hide.

209
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,810
Whenever we get a state of exit or thing.

210
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,240
So the opacity is going to be equal to zero if we have the state exiting or exit exit.

211
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,240
And if we have entering or entered we want to change it to 1.

212
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:44,520
So again we're going to be using turnaround and it's going to be state triple equal to exit it good.

213
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,390
And then I'm going to be adding the.

214
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,050
Or Oh sorry.

215
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,410
It would be adding the or 0.

216
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,450
Let me one second I just changed the key words.

217
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:01,480
So it going to be when you see if I can figure out because it changed keywords and right here have British

218
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,040
because I have a keyboard and you know it's going to be using possibly the R and find the or her source

219
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,440
for that.

220
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,110
I got it.

221
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,430
So it's going to be or.

222
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,740
And of course we're going to do the same thing is going to be state and 3PL equals to the all the other

223
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,220
state which is going to be exiting so exiting Burguet.

224
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,700
So of course we get this to states.

225
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,800
It's going to be equal to zero.

226
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,650
And if not it's going to be equal to what is going to be showing the dev.

227
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,510
So whenever the application starts of course it's going to be showing to true.

228
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,340
So this one is going to have the class of entered the state of Intrade and you know just let me put

229
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,290
this to the state right here.

230
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,040
All right.

231
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,470
So we're going to reload and you know the application starts.

232
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,740
There is no transition but we get the the state of this debate which is going to be entered.

233
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,380
They've already entered.

234
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,270
So it's like click hide or show it's going to do exiting the animation stops.

235
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,190
And the element is not there anymore.

236
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:09,220
And if I click it's going to change the state to entering and when it's done it's going to change it

237
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,050
to enter.

238
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,620
Good.

239
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,100
You know so this is how we use transition's group.

240
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,170
We're not going to do the animation.

241
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,970
The transition's group is going to just give you a state or a class something like that so you can do

242
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,050
the animation using CSSA.

243
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,180
That's how trance react transitions group works.

244
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,610
Of course we can do a lot of things with this not just this.

245
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,030
And you know this writing all of this to do a simple animation.

246
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,470
It's a real pain in the ass.

247
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,860
I know.

248
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,890
I know what you're thinking.

249
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,180
So we're going to be doing all the things and this is one is going to get a little bit simpler.

250
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,090
So with this transitions and pretty much with all the other ones you're going to get two different choices

251
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,860
begin to get options of course.

252
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,890
And one of the options is going to be mount on enter.

253
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,800
Let me delete it right now and let me show you.

254
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,250
So when does the application start.

255
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,930
You know we get the dip.

256
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,210
So if I hide everything.

257
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,600
So the state of this is going to be non-visible.

258
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,490
But if you take a look right here we have a big space so Divx.

259
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,800
It's hidden.

260
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,610
But of course it's occupying space right here.

261
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,280
The div..

262
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,520
It's inside the door.

263
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,290
OK.

264
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:33,220
So if I do this just like that me add there the the amount on enter or go.

265
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,330
And of course we have a different options which is going to be the opposite of Mount on enter.

266
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,580
Are going to be unmount on exit.

267
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,890
So we have the mount on guns or if I click show or hide.

268
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,260
It's going to be hiding this and when it's exiting it's going to be done.

269
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,540
But the div. it's not there anymore.

270
00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:00,460
So if we have an unmount on X exit transition is going to know because it knows that the div it's not

271
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,430
there anymore it's exit it.

272
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,000
So it's going to be grabbing that element from the DOM and you know just remove the item from the DOM.

273
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,880
And if we click it is going to be mounting again.

274
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,820
OK.

275
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,500
That's it.

276
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,930
You know it's not that hard but you need to do a lot of coding just to get this simple thing.

277
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,200
But you know it's going to get a little bit better.

278
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,650
OK.

279
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,900
Let's go to the next section and see the other.

280
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,550
The other one.

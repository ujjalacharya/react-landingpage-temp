1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,730
So in the re-act world there are many many ways to style our projects.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,450
So we're going to be talking about some different methods going to show you different ways.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:17,260
So first we have the inline styling with re-act we can do what we can do is create an object that looks

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,710
like a C Ss and then pass the properties to the actual element.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,630
I know sounds kind of confusing.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm going to do it right now.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,570
And by the way I've added Google fonts to our project is going to be the aunt.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,080
Finally you can choose whatever font you wish.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,380
It's up to you.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,660
So I'm going to go back to the header and I'm going to create a variable that is going to be an object

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,910
and noticed that I'm doing it inside the render OK.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,620
So I'm going to say let.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
And this is of course 6 is going to create a variable.

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,120
This could be Konst.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,770
Thus I'm going to say Konst.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,620
So it's going to be equal to styles.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,670
And this is style.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,700
It's going to be an actual object.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,580
So right here inside styles are going to add a property for the header and for the logo.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,070
Real simple just an object notation.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,090
So it's going to be Hetter and header is going to have several properties.

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,830
You can have background just like that and the background is going to be a color and it's going to be

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,490
called two hash tag then 0 3 a 9 4.

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:25,720
But now I'm going to add logo and since it's an update I'm going to do a coma and create the logo one

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,020
and logo of course it's going to have several properties you can have a color you can do something simple

26
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,350
a color of white.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:41,430
It's going to be white one two three and then coma and I need to put the font family with standard DSS

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,750
what you do is font then style and then family.

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,600
But this is not yes that's going to be Javascript.

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:55,370
So we need to keep the hyphens and do it all together family family all the OK.

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,000
And that's what is going to be equal to on the phone to Google phone.

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,110
I just added.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,880
So we're going to do coma and we can add a new property and I'm going to do text align and remember

34
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,930
this is javascript.

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,870
We do in camel case text align and text line is going to be center just like that.

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,460
So now how do we pass this styles to reference to this to the sex.

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,420
So what we can do we can go right here to the Petar for example and we're going to say style equals

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,180
to something since you're going to be passing object data you know javascript.

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,390
We cannot use this.

40
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,900
We cannot use the double quotes what are begin going to use curly braces and begin to make a reference

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,980
to that object is going to be styles.

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,160
Remember we have styles and then pass the property.

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,000
That's the one we want.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,630
And if I reload the page you know it's working.

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,450
So I'm going to go to logo and do the same thing styles style it called to an object and it's going

46
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,090
to be styles dot logo.

47
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,160
And if you go right here we have the Anton and the logo with the center text.

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,220
Let's get you know it works.

49
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,650
So again you know imagine that you have tons of styles right here.

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,350
So you know you're going to have a pretty long file.

51
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,860
You can do an import you know of a could you could have this inside of a different javascript and then

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,440
include the variables.

53
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,450
Right here you could do that if you wish.

54
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't really like this method because everything it's inline it's inside the actual elements.

55
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,100
And you know I like it.

56
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,080
So what we could do.

57
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,830
Let me just delete this.

58
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,650
You're not going to need it for now.

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,330
Sorry.

60
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm going to leave it so I can copy it.

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,590
Remove the heterostyled and then remove the one in the logo.

62
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,470
So what we could do we could do it the old fashioned way we can.

63
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,640
We can put a link inside the index to a real CSSA file.

64
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,060
So I'm going to go to public and I'm going to create a new folder that it's going to be.

65
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,560
Now let's create a new file.

66
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,420
Let me show you why in a minute it's going to be styles going to call it styles not us.

67
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,430
So this stylus is going to have a stylus of course.

68
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:20,200
So first going out of body to remove the margin the ugly margin that we get by default with with you

69
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,790
now.

70
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,720
OK so I'm going to say margined zero.

71
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,290
Then of course the header and on the head are if you remember we have text a line background.

72
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:29,770
Sorry.

73
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,210
So I'm going to copy it from here.

74
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,760
That's why I left it.

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:40,520
Background and the background is going to be the color I'm going to do text align and then Center.

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,440
What else.

77
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,380
We have the logo so I'm going to create a class with logo and then the logo is going to be color of

78
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:57,080
white then koma font size font size and the font size is going to be I don't know 40 pixels.

79
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,810
Sounds good.

80
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,530
What else.

81
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,550
We have the really get to do fun family and it's going to be on time.

82
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,230
Very good.

83
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,790
Now we have the input so I'm going to add styles for the impot going to be using this later.

84
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,710
That's why I'm doing it right now.

85
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,040
It's going to be head or input.

86
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,450
And I'm going to add some font size something really simple.

87
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,610
So we don't waste too much time then we could have a margin.

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,910
Let's add a margin of 20 pixels and then zero pixels from the side.

89
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,660
Let's get it.

90
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,970
So now how do how do we include this.

91
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,110
You know we are inside the public folder.

92
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,260
So everything you have in public is going to go to the real world is going to go to production.

93
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,830
Let's say so right here what I can do I can just add a reference to that idea.

94
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,750
Yes.

95
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:53,830
So we say link a draft and then we pastilles that CSSA just like that.

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,950
And of course I'm going to do the role just to make things right.

97
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,760
And then we do stylesheet of course style sheet and we load the application.

98
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,170
We are kind of getting it you're not getting the background C-y.

99
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,020
It's because I forgot to remove this.

100
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,120
So you know let's get that's the old fashioned way.

101
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,230
Now there is a different way and a lot of developers like they like to do this.

102
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,700
I don't really like it but you know you could use it.

103
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,690
I'm going to leave this right here the logo we need to add a class.

104
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,240
Remember we add a class right here to logo.

105
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,510
So we are not going to use class but we use class name.

106
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,700
And this one is going to be called to a logo.

107
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,860
And if we reloaded we get the content.

108
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,770
That's good.

109
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,510
So what you can do.

110
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:50,440
You can import that CSSA right here on the javascript and then whenever you are the web pack it's compiling

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,640
all the information it's going it's going to include that javascript.

112
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,610
I'm sorry that CSSA inside the blue.

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,240
So how do we import it.

114
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,410
This is real simple.

115
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,430
I'm going to say import just like that import.

116
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,500
The thing is here comes the problem.

117
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:14,570
You cannot import files from when the public folder the only files that you can import might hear that

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:21,360
pack is going to let you import are going to be you know they need to be inside the source father.

119
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,740
So if I do public it's not kind of let me.

120
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,380
So let me let me just show you.

121
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Going to say we're going to open up right here single quotes and we're not importing Javascript.

122
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,950
So whenever we import CSSA we do import and then we pass the location of that file.

123
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,480
So right here we're inside indexed.

124
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,210
So I'm going to say that that forward slash and are going to go to that that forward slash and go to

125
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,300
public folder and the public is going to bring the styles that CSSA just like that you're getting out

126
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,520
of the index entering the public and bring in CSX.

127
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,450
And right here it's going to say you attempt to import public styles he assess which which falls outside

128
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,550
the project's source directory.

129
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,000
So you know we cannot do this we can bypass and just trying to modify things but we're not going to

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,850
do that.

131
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,750
What I'm going to do I'm going to just have to see a just create a new folder inside here that is going

132
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,840
to be called CSX and right here going it just grab the styles and put it inside the source.

133
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,410
So I got to go back to Hetter and instead of doing this we just delete it.

134
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,940
We're going to say that for Slash we're going to go into SS for Slash and we're going to bring this

135
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,500
dials Nazi SS and if we reload this it's going to work.

136
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,750
That's going to work.

137
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,850
Now what is the downside of this if you consider this as a downside of course.

138
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,190
Whenever we do the application LOTES the pack is going to convert everything is going to transpire everything

139
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,100
and it's going to give you that Mandola.

140
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,940
Yes.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,320
But in addition you're passing an import.

142
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,250
So this information this into the C Ss is going to get compiled with the import with the bundle and

143
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,610
the bundle is going to inject the CSSA inside the DOM.

144
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,840
So if we take a look right here we have it inside the header.

145
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,590
Everything gets injected right here.

146
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:28,040
So let's say you have I don't know three different CSSA style sheets with a lot of code.

147
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,610
A lot of CSSA styles.

148
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,210
They're going to get injected into the DOM.

149
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,680
So again a lot of developers likes like this.

150
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,560
I don't like it that much.

151
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,130
But again it's just up to you.

152
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:48,980
So we have more things with stylings but we can do a lot of tricks with styles.

153
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,840
But the thing is that this tricks we need to use this tricks along with some options with classes and

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,150
with all the things that begin to be using with react.

155
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,100
But we are not there yet.

156
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,180
So I'm not going to show you.

157
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,210
Right now we can wait until we know what else we can do with classes and we'd react and then we to bring

158
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,980
kind of styles sections advanced something like that.

159
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,270
So let's keep moving forward on the next section.

160
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,070
Going to be talking about events and it's going to be really really interesting.

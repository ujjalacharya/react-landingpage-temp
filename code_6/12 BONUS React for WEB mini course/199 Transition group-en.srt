1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,830
OK so we have one more to go.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,130
It's going to be transition's group.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,160
So just like this you know just like it's old before this component is it's just going to add an element

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,280
with a random number.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,350
Every time I click an add element and it's going to remove it if I click Remove elements real simple.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,660
Let's go to the code.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,230
So we have two buttons.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,710
Dinner number and remove number and right here we are just showing whatever we have an at elements of

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,890
elements.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,860
It's just doing a map over the state of items.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,190
So if we have on a number right here is going to be displaying this.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,680
So if I do 56 or whatever it's going to reload the page and we get 56 so you know it's this rendering

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,500
that state.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,620
So whenever we click on Add elements it's going to go to generate number he's going to grab whatever

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,140
state is going to add a random number and then of course he's going to update that state.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,600
The application will be rendered with the new element and it's going to display the elements and the

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,680
same thing happens with remove number is going to remove the last number on that state and then is going

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,450
to be setting state again.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,750
Real simple.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,210
OK.

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,250
So I'm going to remove the five six I'm going to save it.

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,440
And now we're going to be using transmission's group.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,870
Now the main difference of transmission is group the with the transmission and the CSSA condition is

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,860
that we use this one to render lists.

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,350
Right here we are rendering whenever we have inside the array items.

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,410
So we are going to be using transmission's group.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,290
That's the main reason.

28
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,840
So first we need to import everything.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:43,730
So we need to import two things we need to import the CSSA incisions group just like with it before.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,280
Just as transition's concision trend will start again.

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:02:00,790
Tren session and then coma and we need to import transmission and then group just like that group.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,290
So now of course everything is going to be from.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:13,190
And then re-act transition and then group OK Breguet So now what we need to do just like that before

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,080
this element we need to wrap everything inside transition's group.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,500
So I'm going to say transition's group opening close and I'm going to put everything inside.

36
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,260
So now this transition group is going to need you pretty much one thing are going to be adding to.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,260
So the first one is going to be the component.

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,160
Now whenever we specify the component is going to be what this list is going to be.

39
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,020
In this case we're using a list makes sense that we can ever be using.

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,580
We should be using a UL because we're going to be adding lists but in this case I'm going to be using

41
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,310
a device.

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,930
So whenever the application renders is going to create a div that is going to be containing whatever

43
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,760
data we have right here.

44
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,330
So if I go out a class name as well so we can see the difference.

45
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,010
And this one is going to have a class name of list.

46
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,720
So I'm going to inspect are going to add an element I'm going to select 5:52 and notice that right here

47
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,620
we have diffs this class and we have the class of list and each side here we have a def and this one

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,680
again it's a.

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,830
It's not a UL.

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,550
This is because we said that the component should be a div.

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,420
So this one works.

52
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,620
So now how do we add a transition to each element.

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,690
Well now we're going to be using the CSSA transition that we imported on the top.

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,830
I'm going to go right here inside the map and I'm going to wrap everything in.

55
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,990
Inside CSSA transition.

56
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,720
Open it close.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,620
And just like with it before this one there's nothing you write here inside the assessment session.

58
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,210
I need to start adding the props first one are going to add the class names.

59
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:07,740
So this one is going to have an item a class name of item and I need to put the time out and for now

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,360
the time out I'm just going to give it 500 seconds something fast.

61
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,660
Now since this is a list and each time we return something we're going to be returning in a list an

62
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,950
item of that list.

63
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,030
We need a key.

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,620
Remember that with lists we need to add a key.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,660
So I'm going to say key and it's going to be equal to I which is the iteration on each iteration inside

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,100
the map makes sense.

67
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,070
Now one more thing we can have a problem if we render this we going to get the classes and get a good

68
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,600
five second so we can see the classes right here.

69
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,220
I'm going to add I can select and notice that we have item enter and enter active.

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,170
And if I add again item item enter an item active.

71
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,960
Now whenever this is done it's going to be moving and going back to item.

72
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,820
But I need to know whether this item is active or not.

73
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,540
So again we're going to be using the on entered.

74
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:12,210
Same thing we did before on enter it it's going to be equal to opening close and we grab that node and

75
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,870
we do something else with that node.

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,730
So it's going to be adding a class inside this element.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,950
So what we can do we can access the node which is whatever information you have right here.

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:30,150
And again to say Dot and I'm going to enter the classis and then I'm going to say add and now we're

79
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,690
going to say no active access active.

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,370
So now we expect this going to add an element select selected and we have item item enter enter active

81
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,990
and then item and active.

82
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,260
You know this is working.

83
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,080
So this is ready we have all the classes and we have the cost whenever the element is not active.

84
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,080
If we move it is going to do the exit and remove the the element from the list.

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,650
Very good.

86
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,980
So the only thing left is going to be adding the CSSA.

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,430
So OK I'm going to go to app are going to be going to a transmission's group and outclasses the first

88
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,070
one is going to be the item and you can have an A pass city of 0.

89
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,200
What else we can have a transform of translate x.

90
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,590
Same thing with the for minus 100 percent.

91
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,190
And what else we can have the transmission and we're going to say all DOD can give it a half a second

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,210
and that is fine.

93
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,860
But then we have the DOD.

94
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:42,760
And then item and then dot active and we're going to put it all at once I can say item dosh enter and

95
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,720
the other class is going to be item Dasch enter Dasch active.

96
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,740
And this one is going to be opacity of one.

97
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,530
And what else a transform of translate x.

98
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,140
And this one is going to have a zero percent beginning.

99
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,690
HYDE we're going to show it.

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:10,710
So then we have the exit scenario so I'm going to say item that excess exit then dot and then item X

101
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,560
said and then dasht active.

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,660
Remember that you have when we have the option to put enter and then exit and set it a true or false.

103
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,000
So we didn't have to use the exit active and we can use the item active.

104
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,190
OK.

105
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,370
So let me make this right.

106
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:36,900
And this one is going to be opacity of 0 and then we're going to put transform and you know we can hide

107
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,490
it again.

108
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,710
So translate minus 100 percent.

109
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,850
And that is done you know this is going to make the transition.

110
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,370
So I'm going to click and add elements and you know it's doing the transition.

111
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,970
Let me check if we have 500.

112
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,320
No we didn't have it.

113
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,330
Can it put it put in 500.

114
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,010
And it click and add element you know doing the transition can add one more and it's working.

115
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,300
And if I remove it it's going to be removing the element and doing the transmission principle.

116
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,640
So you know it's not that hard to to use once you get the idea of how this works.

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,370
It's read resample.

118
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:25,590
But first it's kind of a weird to to learn how to use is why we can why we're using a class name or

119
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,620
why why were you using it state.

120
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,030
That's the tricky part of CSSA transitional transitional group.

121
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,650
But once you get the idea that you get all the states it's real simple.

122
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:36,990
All right.

123
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,780
So let's go to the next topic.

124
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:44,730
Oh before we go of course you have a lot of different dependencies for transitions.

125
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:53,470
This one is the one you know the one the main one from react but you have other or other dependencies

126
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,020
other components from different vendors.

127
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,710
For example you have one that is going to be called re-act move.

128
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:08,180
That's when it's really good going to go to get have and right here react move.

129
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,530
So again it's just like a library just like applying to do transitions and it's really really complete.

130
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,550
It's not that easy to use.

131
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,210
But of course you can check this out.

132
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,650
Let's see if we can get.

133
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,210
Yes.

134
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,410
Just a live example so you can see what you can do.

135
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,810
It's really really good.

136
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,160
So I'm going to go to examples and you know sort value.

137
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,390
And you know really a very good transition as we go to update.

138
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,340
It works really well.

139
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,100
But again it's not that easy to use.

140
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,950
Of course you need to do a lot of coding and resolved.

141
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,300
It's really cool.

142
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,600
But of course you need to do some work.

143
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,650
Look at this now.

144
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,640
It's good but it's kind of hard to use maybe at the end of the course if you still have time we can

145
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,330
add it can make a tiny tiny tiny section to show you how to use this.

146
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,390
All right so let's keep moving forward with react.

147
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,700
And we're going to be talking about Propp types.

148
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,510
Let's go to the next section and do that.

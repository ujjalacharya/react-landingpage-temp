1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,720
OK so how are we going to be fixing this.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,560
So the solution is going to be dispatching an action whenever this component and mounts.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,200
So if I exit there we trigger a function or an action dispatch an action that is going to be deleting

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,520
whatever data we have inside artist and data write is going to set it to nothing to null.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,110
So that is that's the solution if you want it you can do it alone at home.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,250
If not of course I'm going to do it right here with you.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,910
So first we need an action for this.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,550
So I'm going to go to actions and incite actions are going to create one that is going to be real simple

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,750
to say export than default the fault and then I'm going to call it clear.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,670
And then Art is detail going to copy and paste it and make the capital A.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,330
So there you go.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,610
So this one is going to be real simple.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,870
You're not going to do pretty much.

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,340
You're not going to do anything.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,190
It's just return just like this.

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,420
Open and close.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:13,480
And instead of default sorry my mistake is going to be function and inside the return we pass the type

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:22,380
and I'm going to call it clear underscore artist's artist and the detail and the option that payload

19
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,840
is going to be nothing.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,770
You know we want to do lead to make it.

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,430
No.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,980
So we say payload and it's going to be equal to null.

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,170
So whenever we triggered this actually is going to go to the reducers going to find it and begin to

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,670
be changing that artist data to nothing to know.

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,650
So the next time that it floats the data is not going to be available.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,170
Right.

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,710
OK.

28
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,270
So I'm going to save it.

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,630
I'm going to go to the artists.

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,440
Reduce her and create a new case for this.

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,460
First I'm going to copy the clear detail keyword so I'm going to say Kate case open it close and pass

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,230
the name and we say return return.

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,910
Well return opening close and first one is dot dot dot state.

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,190
And then we make her reference to artist detail with the same information with the action that payload.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,650
So whenever we dispatched this section it goes to this producer artist data is going to be equal to

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,190
null.

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,030
So the next time that it floats nothing it's going to be showing or shown on the screen.

38
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,640
Right.

39
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,810
Makes sense.

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,910
So going to save it.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:35,310
And now we need a way we need to dispatch the action whenever the component component and mounts.

42
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,090
All right.

43
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,830
So I'm going to go over here at the top and this this will get triggered on the component will unmount.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:52,550
So we say components just like this then will and then unmount component will unmount.

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,300
So we didn't have the action we need to bring into the top so I'm going to go to the to the index copy

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,530
the name and go back to artist container and paste it on the top.

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,820
And it's of course to do it on the on the Byne action creators as well.

48
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:11,840
OK.

49
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,770
So that is ready.

50
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,740
We're going to have this function available.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,750
So now this is available I'm going to go right here and say this is that.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,410
Probs dot and clear detail.

53
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,780
That's it.

54
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,040
That is the solution.

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,210
I'm going to go back to home of course we are still with fast 3G so I got to go back to home when we

56
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,170
load the application.

57
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,140
OK Scott it's going to take time while we're going to go to Hendriks I get to go to Hendriks.

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:44,890
OK.

59
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,740
Why Paige.

60
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,990
And then if I go back home and I go to Madona we are not going to get Hendriks you know empty page and

61
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,110
then Madona and same thing if I go to Pink Floyd nothing.

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,530
And then we get pink floyd.

63
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,830
So that is the solution for this.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,280
All right.

65
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:00,690
OK.

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,600
Just like I told you before with redux everything is redundant after a while after you know how to do

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,040
this.

68
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,810
You can have some snippets available.

69
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,000
You're going to trigger certain commands and it's going to do everything for you just like this one.

70
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,880
The only thing you will need to change is going to be this if you're going to be using maps or prompts

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,620
or just this patch and the name of the container of course and the actions but everything else is just

72
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,070
just the same right.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,750
It's always the same idea.

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,480
You are.

75
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,970
This map stage probs you'll dispatch an action update the prompts and then you use it on your application.

76
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,090
It's always the same idea.

77
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,420
All right.

78
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,820
So in the next section we're going to start with.

79
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,620
We're going to start with something else.

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,780
It's going to be really really fun.

81
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,640
Then at the end we're going to do kind of a big project beginning could react beginning called servers.

82
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,210
And of course we are going to be using redux.

83
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,000
And yeah we're going to use redux on a a default on a different level.

84
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,660
Right.

85
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,010
OK so let's go to the next section and start with something else.

1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:00,840
Right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,880
So on this section we we'll be talking about re-act router.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,730
What is re-act router.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,140
Well maybe in the future you want to build an application that has more than one view.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,210
For example just to give you an example.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm going to go to facebook page and if I go to Home let me just go to home.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,920
The application is going to load.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,690
And of course you can it get home.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,100
But of course you have different options right here.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,040
For example if I go to Iowa this is going to go to a different view and notice that the u r l is changing.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,970
So react is to create single page applications.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,990
We don't have this behavior we cannot achieve this ride out of the box.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,820
We didn't have the ability to do it.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,750
So we need to add a middleware or extension or library whatever you want to call it.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,040
So we can achieve this behavior.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,440
And this is going to be called re-act router is to create routes.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,920
So we will start with a clean project we're going to start all over again and we're going to go to the

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,570
terminal.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:06,960
Notice that I've created a new folder to react live cycles writer say router and then life cycles at

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,420
the end of the section will be it will be we will be talking about life cycles don't worry we will get

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,110
there is going to blow your mind.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,720
So navigate I'm navigated to the to the same directory so we can do the Create react with it before

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,290
we're going to say create re-act app.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,560
And then since I'm inside the directory I'm going to do space and the DOD just like that are going to

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,470
press center.

26
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,750
It's going to take a few minutes.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,550
So I'm going to pass the PTO and be right back.

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,680
OK so everything gets installed.

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,770
And just like before we get to do is just delete all the files we have right here and start from scratch.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
So I'm going to go to the public folder.

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,510
I'm going to delete everything but the indexed DML going to send it to trash.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,370
Then we're going to go to the source folder and I'm going to delete everything but the index that jazz.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,080
So OK so I'm going to just oh I made mistakes or we're going to delete everything.

34
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,310
Move to trash.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,590
We only get the index digests.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,150
And I'm going to go to the index dodgiest it again.

37
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,810
We're going to delete everything.

38
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,960
We're going to start from scratch.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,370
Burguet so we can you know we can practice a little bit.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,810
So we you can be using re-act Browder and this is a different module.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,210
So we need to install it.

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,960
So we're going to go to the terminal I'm going to do clear and begin to install the router.

43
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,500
Me make this bigger.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to say NPM install and then re-act dash router dash and then Dohm and begin to use a very

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
specific version.

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
It's going to be the for that to that zero.

47
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,990
This is the latest version up to date.

48
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,810
You know the date of course.

49
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,980
So this module keeps updating the whole time.

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,320
That's why I'm using an app specific person to keep consistency of course.

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,540
Of course if there is a breaking change I'm going to just update this.

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,880
So we're going to do space and minus minus save going to press center and it's not that heavy so it

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,940
should take just a couple of minutes maybe less of course a couple seconds minutes.

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,450
It's too much.

55
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,170
So OK it's going.

56
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,210
Almost done OK.

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,840
So OK so installed and we got no errors.

58
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,340
All right.

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,240
So you know we have a different process between how the web works today or how we've worked.

60
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,320
A while ago and it works in a different way so let me explain what happens when we get a request for

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,860
our application first.

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,370
OK so this is what's happening outside of the world of single page apps on let's say multi-page apps.

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,920
So you're going to get a request for docs that come it's going to be your domain your Eurail you're

64
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,650
going to have your application.

65
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,890
So this is going to make a request to a server.

66
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,710
The servers can find a file that belongs to that URL and then it's going to return that it's going to

67
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,690
give you or give you a response with that file and it's going to reload the browser and you're going

68
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,320
to have your application.

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,600
Now for example let's say that the user clicks on a link and goes to a different page.

70
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,670
Inside are our domain our application.

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,310
So then again who's going to repeat the same process beginning to enter to the Shittu page of our application

72
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,830
and it's going to make it detect a change and the you are all going to go to the server the server will

73
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,590
find the file will reload the browser and display the file.

74
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:45,330
So this is how it works how we know that it works on multi-page applications now on single single page

75
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,980
applications.

76
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,530
It's going to work a little bit different.

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,660
So let's go right here.

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,240
So we have our application inside docs that come.

79
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,550
So of course we make a request that this server is going to it's going to go to the server and the server

80
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,090
is going to return our application.

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,970
Now our application is going to be a single page and it's going to have different parts.

82
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,260
So first we can have a history.

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,180
Now this history is going to keep a log of when the world changes.

84
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,060
So for example if I go to docs that come dash should sue.

85
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,340
The history is going to be listening for that.

86
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,980
It is going to grab your L and store it kind of like a big Jason with all the bells.

87
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,530
So then we have the re-act router.

88
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,810
So the router is going to be checking the history it's going to be listening for changes.

89
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,070
So whenever we get a change on the Ural it's going to detect it.

90
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,880
And then when it's detecting everything is going to go and find Dimanche those that are linked to that

91
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,740
you are l.

92
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,550
So let's say we have a Shittu.

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,590
We're going to go to the model that belongs to Shittu.

94
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,880
And then is going to say react.

95
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,160
We have a we have a change on the history.

96
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,880
So we need to you need to show this component.

97
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,470
So was the reactors going to say OK so I'm going to grab the component laying to that Eurail and then

98
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm going to show that components.

99
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,000
And of course it's going to give you that view.

100
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,010
So this is what's happening behind the scenes with re-act router and now we're going to begin to learn

101
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,780
everything that we need to learn to use re-act router and create kind of a multi bew single page apps.

102
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,180
OK.

103
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,780
Let's go to the next section and start with router.

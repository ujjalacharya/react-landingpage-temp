1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,650
OK so so far we've been using keywords like component's imbues and that is fine but we read with three

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,930
ducks we need to use something else.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:18,620
Whenever we have a component that is strictly related to the redux store we need to say that this component

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,340
it's a container.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,130
All right.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,290
So whenever we have this type of components we need to put them on a different place.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,270
So I'm going to go to source code and create a new folder called containers and inside containers.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,260
I'm going to grab the app that is going to promote this to containers.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,630
Right.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,230
OK.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,350
Of course the application would crash.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,790
We need to change all the routes.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,620
So now is not going to be in app anymore it's going to be in DOD containers and then app and then app

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,010
is going to fail because we know we don't have the correct pack path for actions.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,950
So we can do that for I-Slash actions.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,570
Right.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,690
And if I save it it's going to work just fine.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,410
Now there's one more thing right here.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,450
Well we shouldn't be rendering a lot of data.

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,730
You know it's not meant to do that.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,170
What we need to do right here we just need to be passing the props so to some other component that is

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,530
going to be just grabbing the prompts so rendering here just a lot of HD M-L and that thing is not recommended.

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,920
So what are we going to be doing.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,060
I'm going to go to source and are going to create a new folder called components.

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,170
We know there's one components.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,780
Now these components that we see probably from a container up awfully They are called in a different

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,150
way just like this one just like this one which is a container.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,030
There are going to be called the presentational components but it's FAE's just a component.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,230
I'm going to name it.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,180
So you should be may name this movie this list makes sense.

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,170
Yeah.

32
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,620
So I'm going to say.

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,780
And this one is going to be just a functional component so I'm going to do re-act stay list component

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,510
Precentor and it's going to create that snippet for me.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,060
This is a different plugging I have installed.

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:16,200
It's going to be you let me find Ed there react Jasc code snippets.

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,750
That's pretty cool.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,020
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to just put movies list movies and then list right.

39
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,390
And then of course I'm going to export this.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,560
This component is going to be receiving props of course.

41
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,500
And I'm just going to do the console log just to see the props console log and then props.

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,550
So now this one is going to be receiving the props from the parent component.

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,590
This one is a child and the parent is going to be the app.

44
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,450
So now get a copy this function because begin if needed.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,460
On the other components and it's just going to paste it here at the bottom.

46
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,050
So now inside app what we need to do.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,850
Let me do Konst of course.

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,860
So this is going to be just receiving the movies and right here we can make a reference to render them

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,800
movies and then we're going to be passing whatever we see inside props the same thing with it right

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
here.

51
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,260
Now we don't have this anymore.

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,120
Now we need to include the presentational component.

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:26,750
It's going to be in port then we can call the movies and then list the Make It Right.

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,460
There we go.

55
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,920
And then it's going to be from the forward slash components forward slash and then movies list resemble

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,380
going to grab this movie Liz and I are going in the lead of this are going to make her reference to

57
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,430
this component.

58
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,060
And since this one is going to be receiving props I'm going to do this.

59
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,220
I'm sorry Dad.

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,500
Dad this dad props just going to pass all the props for now.

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,230
I'm going to go back to movies list and read this one.

62
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,640
It's going to be rendering let me say right here inside movies list.

63
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,260
We are getting the props now with all the data.

64
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,610
So now what do we need to do is we need to pass a reference to render movies.

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,280
So we're going to say prompts dot data dot movies.

66
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,710
And you know we get the same results as just the the index with the array.

67
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,270
So let me just fix it right now.

68
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,940
There is no need.

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,090
No I just don't like this.

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,690
Error messages are going to be adding just the index is going to be key.

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,910
And then the key is going to be called to.

72
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,150
I just like with it before that is done.

73
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:47,260
So this is the last thing we're going to be discussing in about a redux the most basic redux on the

74
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,540
next few sections we're going to be doing a lot more redux.

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,670
And we're going to be starting a tiny tiny application.

76
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,300
It's going to be just just for practice.

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,880
Not like the MBA app is just going to be something for practice.

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,530
I can create a template with all the routes and everything else so we don't lose time doing that.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,660
And then what are we going to be doing is going to grab that project template and we're going to be

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,720
putting redux on the top.

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,190
All right.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,340
So let's go to the next section and start doing that.

1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,150
All right so now we're going to be talking about forms.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,510
We're going to be talking about controlled and uncontrolled.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,820
So first we're going to be using a template I've made so you need to download it.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,470
You can find it in the project resource.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,960
So downlow the project put it inside a folder whatever folder doesn't matter.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
And then of course you need to navigate to that folder.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,950
I've called mine 0 5 forms and then you need to do NPM install so you it's going to go and download

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,220
all the dependencies.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,920
And after you are done you need to do and pm start just like that.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,360
I'm going to run it right now because everything is installed for me.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,740
So it's going to show it's right here.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,090
So this is what we're going to get.

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,870
It's going to reload in a second.

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,920
So this is what we get.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,540
We're going to have three different routes right here.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,650
We have a do we have a controlled controlled and then a user is going to be doing something else right

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,700
here.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,010
Right from the start we have an uncontrolled component and are controlled by you.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
Sorry not component.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,810
So first we're going to be using the control we're going to build a controlled component so going to

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,980
close everything I have right here is all I'm going to go to controlled.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,300
So inside control we just have a class based component with the state and you know with render really

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,060
really simple.

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,040
So remember to download and run it.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,760
OK.

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,360
So OK so a control component.

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,760
It's whenever we use re-act 100 percent.

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,550
And you know we don't bypass react just like we do with draps.

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,640
So the best example comes directly from the playbook and it's of course working with forms.

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,340
So right here we're going to have a just component.

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,040
OK.

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,590
And the Whenever we work with the form whenever we use control component everything has to go through

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,430
state.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,770
You know nuts just like ref.

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,580
We don't put the things directly into the DOM.

36
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,870
So let's build a form that's really the form for this and to begin to be changing everything else and

37
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,680
passing the functions so we can know and see how a control component works.

38
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,850
So OK so first they're going to have a div that it's going to have a class name of container inside

39
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:15,030
the the up the CSSA you all have already have the styles so you don't have to worry about that.

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,530
So we have a class named container and inside of course we can have a form.

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,900
So I'm going to open and close the form.

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,620
Right.

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,290
So inside a form we can have two different elements one for a name and one for last name.

44
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,200
It's a very simple form.

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:40,170
So inside form I can have one element that is going to have a class name of form element just like that.

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,880
OK.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,440
So then we're going to have a label of course because we need a label just to be correct and my label

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,550
is going to say Antar name makes sense right.

49
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,260
OK.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,660
What else you're going to have an input and the input is going to be I'm going to put it down here is

51
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,060
going to be equal type.

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,060
And of course it's going to be equal text.

53
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,740
And then for now I'm just going to close it.

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,930
Begin to do more here in a minute.

55
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,410
We're going to have a different a different container just a different div.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,220
It's going to be the same class opening close just like this and we're going to have a different level

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,800
on going to copy this and paste at the bottom because I'm lazy and it's going to be.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,020
Enter last name.

59
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,220
Makes sense again.

60
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,770
Then we can have a different input and this input again is going to be type text.

61
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,720
So I'm going to copy the one we have on top and paste it down here.

62
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,060
So I'm going to delete this again to save the form.

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,570
And you know we get the Leavell and the input Frigga.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,810
So now the thing is that whenever we use a control component because we are in the control view everything

65
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,030
needs to go through react.

66
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,300
If I type something right here this for example let's say Francis this Francis.

67
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,610
Being put by the by us inside the actual input.

68
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,410
So we put it directly into the DOM right.

69
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,590
We're putting the data inside the input ourselves.

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,970
And so this is not controlled because this Francis is not going through state.

71
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,600
So what we need to do we need to do something right here create a couple of functions and this function

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,760
will detect when we type something inside here.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,360
And instead of putting it right here is going to add the state is going to read render with this value

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,950
and it's going to putit react is going to put that value for us around.

75
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,230
So OK so first what do we need first we need a value right here in this input we don't have a value.

76
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,460
So I'm going to say value is going to be equal to you know something else and we're going to say this

77
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,180
that state that name we don't have it we're going to create it in a minute.

78
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,350
I'm going to copy this one.

79
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,150
I'm going to put it at the bottom and this one is going to be last name last name.

80
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,120
We're going to have the state.

81
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,940
So let's create it right now.

82
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:03,060
We're going to go right here and we're going to say name and it's going to be to Francis whatever coma.

83
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,920
And then last name Jones.

84
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:14,540
So now if you reload the application we do have a stading site value so react it's placing the values

85
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,980
whenever the application Lute's you know makes sense.

86
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,690
Now of course we don't want to do this.

87
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:28,550
We want to pass an empty stage and have re-act put the data that in pass since begin to be typing things.

88
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,390
We need an event listener.

89
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,530
So we're going to do on change now whenever we the emptiness re-act is going to run a function.

90
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:43,400
So I'm going to say this dot handle and you can choose whatever name you want right here handle name

91
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,120
change makes sense.

92
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,160
OK.

93
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,590
I'm going to do the same thing going to copy the onchange and I'm going to paste it down here but this

94
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,100
one instead of name is going to be last name.

95
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,550
All right going to save it for now of course we didn't have this functions.

96
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,080
We need to create them.

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,640
OK.

98
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,560
So I'm going to go right here.

99
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,730
And at the top going to get it just create two different functions.

100
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm going to say handle name change is going to be equal and we can grab that event that is going to

101
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,860
be provided by the change even listener.

102
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,760
So OK I'm going to say event now.

103
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:31,350
First thing it to do console log and check the event dot target dot value just like that.

104
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,060
OK.

105
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,850
And I'm going to do the same thing and again copy this and paste it at the bottom and this one is going

106
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,100
to be last name.

107
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,530
So we're going to have two functions for two different inputs.

108
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,350
OK.

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,380
Now if I'm going to open the console let me put it at the bottom.

110
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,540
Now this one let me make a bigger because I see the options.

111
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
There we go.

112
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,150
I'm going to put it at the bottom.

113
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,330
Good.

114
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,300
I'm going to be opening the console.

115
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,170
There you go.

116
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:07,010
So now if I type something we get an F and if I type something else we get an F and if I type a letter

117
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:07,890
we get a name.

118
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:13,760
So we get one character individually because we are typing only one character.

119
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,880
The thing is that whenever we do this you know re-act is going to grab that the letter is going to show

120
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,450
it right here.

121
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,250
But the thing is that nothing gets placed right here.

122
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,360
So this function the main purpose of having this function is going to be updating the state.

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,500
So the next time we type we can have all their information right here.

124
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,620
So let me show you how to handle change.

125
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,790
I'm going to say this that said state said the new state and this one is going to be equal to name.

126
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,500
And we pass the same thing.

127
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,450
Event the target the value.

128
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,460
OK.

129
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,070
So let's try again.

130
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,110
So if I type an F the F stays right here inside the input.

131
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,110
You're right and this f is going to be placed by the state.

132
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,370
Remember that we are the state then the application is going to read render.

133
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,610
And now the Baalu is going to be equal to f..

134
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,880
Now if I type an e d e it's still going to get there because the application is going to add that E

135
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,740
F and that e is going to abduct this state the obligation will we render.

136
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,370
And now the value is going to be f e.

137
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,490
And the same thing as long as we type No the information is still there.

138
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,440
It's not getting delete.

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,280
And OK so what is the point of doing all of this whenever we type something we are not entering the

140
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,950
information directly into the input re-act is doing this through the state.

141
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:47,860
You know whenever the we we render is going to output whatever we have inside this state and whatever

142
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,730
input you know that's the main idea of using a control component.

143
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,960
You don't do things manually re-act is going to do it for you.

144
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,670
So I'm going to say last name just like that.

145
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,780
An ok and everything should work and if I say Frances we get Frances and if I say last name we get the

146
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,560
last name.

147
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,070
So you know this is the main idea of using a control component.

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,480
And if on the future in future you will work with the forms.

149
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,780
This should be the best approach working with state and you know using a control component.

150
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,510
We have the other way which is an uncontrolled component and we're going to be talking about this right

151
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:28,870
now.

152
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,590
OK so now let's see how an uncontrolled component works.

153
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,720
We know how a controlled compound works.

154
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,480
So let's talk about this one.

155
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,890
I'm going to be going to controlled and because I don't want to type all over all over again I'm just

156
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,750
going to copy the whole container.

157
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,190
This is going to copy go to control and just paste it down there.

158
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,780
There's a few things that we need to delete.

159
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,880
We don't need the on change and we don't need the values are going to go ahead and just delete those

160
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,240
ones.

161
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,990
OK good.

162
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,290
We're going to save it.

163
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's go to our control and inside of control we get the same result.

164
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,310
The Enter name and enter last name.

165
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,580
So with an uncontrolled component we don't use the state.

166
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:16,010
There is no need to use the state because we are going to get that information devalues directly from

167
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,690
the DOM.

168
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,420
OK.

169
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,960
So how do we use an uncontrolled component how do we make it an uncontrolled.

170
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,540
Well we use refs.

171
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,060
We talked about refs in the future in the past.

172
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,080
So we're going to be using refs to catch the value of each input.

173
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,040
So I'm going to go ahead and just do it.

174
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,230
I'm going to say ref.

175
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,310
And now this is going to look a little bit weird.

176
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,320
Let me type it first.

177
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,750
I'm going to say input is going to be equal to this name.

178
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,120
And then it's going to be equal to input.

179
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,290
So that's pretty much what we're doing.

180
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:52,160
We're creating a variable called this that name and that this that name contains whatever information

181
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,710
we have inside the input.

182
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,180
No just like event this input this variable right here.

183
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,780
It's just like an event.

184
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,670
We catch it.

185
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,180
We create desirable and we put inside this marble whatever we have inside this event.

186
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,450
This is the main reason.

187
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:12,760
So now whenever we use that name it's going to store this viable that there's that name inside the class

188
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:18,950
so we can make a reference to that wherever we are and you know and get the values of this input.

189
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:25,170
Of course right here we could use something else but we're going to lead the state doesn't matter.

190
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,670
So we have the this name that contains all the information about this.

191
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,240
OK.

192
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,940
So we need to do the same thing with the last name.

193
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,210
So I'm going to copy all of this in a copy and then just paste it at the bottom and I'm going to say

194
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,050
last name.

195
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,920
So now we have a variable called this last name that contains all the information about the template.

196
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,930
So now I'm going to be adding something.

197
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,650
We're going to be of course extending this a lot so I'm going to say button and now whenever we submit

198
00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:00,680
the form I want to get the values that we have inside ref but I need a way I need something that tells

199
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,080
me that the user submitted the form so I'm going to create an unclick for now.

200
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,940
We're going to do this in a different way in a minute.

201
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,580
And this button is going to be opening close and we're going to say button.

202
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
There we go.

203
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,570
And this button is going to say don't no sign and good because we have a user and last name whatever

204
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,760
it did register you know.

205
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,230
So this unclick is going to be running a function.

206
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,610
So again we're going to call it handle self.

207
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,110
And then just click you know make sense.

208
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,350
So the main purpose of this function is going to be grabbing whatever we have and this ref.

209
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,980
So going to go right here at the top of me just copy the name going to go right here.

210
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,930
The tab is going to be creating a marble I'm sorry a function that is going to be doing all the logic

211
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,840
with this refs so I'm going to say Handels of Klegg is going to be equal to the event because we are

212
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,460
using any vandalism were going to be grabbing that event and then say prevent and then default.

213
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,650
Of course we need to prevent the default behavior of this form because if we click on this it's going

214
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,910
to be made in the form and the application will reload.

215
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,900
And we don't want that.

216
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,990
With this we prevent that.

217
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,870
This is standard Javascript.

218
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,990
So now we need to get the information that we have inside this name and this last name.

219
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,820
OK so I'm going to go round here and going to say Konst values.

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,640
It's going to be it called to name and last name.

221
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,420
You know the two inputs we have last name.

222
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,270
OK.

223
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,380
So the name is going to be equal to this the name.

224
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,510
And now we need to get the values since we restored this.

225
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,820
We're going to save value and there we go.

226
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,090
We can't get the value of this that name.

227
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,290
And the same thing with this that last name dot value.

228
00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:01,570
All right I'm going to do Cancellara just like this and I'm going to get values about values.

229
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,380
Let's make it plural bodies.

230
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,150
There you go.

231
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,270
So now I'm going to go to Control of course I'm going to type something it's going to be Frances.

232
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,910
And the last name is going to be Jones.

233
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,290
Now this information we are entering the characters and you know Francis and Jones inside the input

234
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,920
directly inside Dom react is not doing this job for us.

235
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,750
We are just entering the information.

236
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,860
So now whenever we click on sign n this handles of click is going to grab the formation stored inside

237
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,000
an object and then begin to get it.

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,230
So if I do sign and we get named Francis and last name JONES So this works.

239
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,790
But this of course is an uncontrolled component.

240
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,560
We don't have a state and re-act is not entering and just ruling the information for us.

241
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,360
We are just doing it directly with drafts.

242
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,910
So this is an example of uncontrolled and control component.

243
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,110
And of course in the future whenever we you work with forms you can use whatever you want.

244
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,050
You know you can use a control and you can use an uncontrolled.

245
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,110
And of course the main difference is that using a control component needs more logic a lot more code

246
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,020
you know right this way you could do this directly you know which is much much simpler.

247
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:22,310
But again if you're using react to y bypassing react if you're going to use re-act use we 100 percent

248
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,600
not just half way.

249
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:24,980
OK.

250
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,860
So bear on this course we're going to use the correct way to encode the correct way.

251
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,950
We're just going to be using a controlled component.

252
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,250
Now this set up right here you can choose to do something like this.

253
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,850
It's still going to work of course and I'm going to do one more thing I'm going to go to control components.

254
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,580
And now the thing is that right here you're clicking the handles of click to get the values.

255
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,280
OK.

256
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,010
So how do we do to get the data from this one.

257
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:03,380
You know from the state if you remember right here in form what we can do we can say on SIFF med just

258
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,190
like that.

259
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,870
And then we're going to be passing a function then I'm going to be calling this that on as handler or

260
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,690
whatever doesn't matter.

261
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:20,620
So this on as handler the main job of this one is going to be stopping the form from submission.

262
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,980
So I'm going to go and copy the event prevent default.

263
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,330
And now where do we have the information about the inputs inside the state.

264
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,080
Right.

265
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:40,940
So if I do console that law then this opening the the server that stayed we should be getting the information

266
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,340
about the form.

267
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,650
So ok me.

268
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,680
I made a mistake for the user and whatever.

269
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,310
Ok so I'm going to say event I forgot to do that.

270
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,130
So going to reload the application.

271
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,430
I'm inside control.

272
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,330
I do Francis and then Jones.

273
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,060
And then of course I don't have a button but I'm going to press enter.

274
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,880
OK.

275
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:10,100
When we just do it like this I'm going to do Bunin and then I have met and that type is going to be

276
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,050
Superman of course

277
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,370
reload again.

278
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,610
It's going to be Francis and then Jones and then SIFF mad.

279
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,300
You know we get the same information we get the name and we get the last name.

280
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,060
So the way to get the information about your form and all the inputs is through state because we are

281
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,120
using control.

282
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,220
So with these on submit you get to know when the user is submitting something.

283
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,210
So you just get to the state of whatever you have inside the form and then you just do the network request

284
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,790
to store the information or to log in the user or whatever is that you want to do with with this information.

285
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,740
All right of course this is a very very simple approach.

286
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:00,160
On the next sections we're going to be discussing kind of a I wouldn't say better but it's a more complete

287
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,970
and complex way to work with forms.

288
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,020
Because of course whenever you were forms you need to validate the information and you need to do a

289
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,860
lot of things.

290
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,410
OK.

291
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,610
So we're going to be doing that.

292
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,910
We're going to be building a template inside the user where the user is going to enter something formation

293
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,020
and we're going to be using a template to validate everything to show the inputs.

294
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,190
And you know we're going to be using a lot of logic.

295
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,500
So it's going to take a little bit of time.

296
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,210
So grab a cup of coffee and let's begin with that.

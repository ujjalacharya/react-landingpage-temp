1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,830
So one of the most important things when we work with applications just like re-act are going to be

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,800
events you know when the user clicks on something or maybe they enter some text inside an input or maybe

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,730
when they are on something.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,020
So let's say that whenever the user clicks on the logo I want to get something I want to get that event.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,940
And you know do a console log.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,300
So OK first we need to be taught we need to talk about handlers or the events you know just like we

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,720
did with vanilla jacks.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,690
We have events that we can listen.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,030
In this case with vanilla it's going to be on and then click just like that.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,050
But with that react it's a little bit different.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,910
It's going to be on an income case click just like that.

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,470
This one it's not going to work because it's vanilla jazz but this one is going to work because it's

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,950
react now.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,190
If you don't know what vanilla jazz is it's going to be the raw javascript not the ESX but the previous

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,380
version.

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,540
That's good.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,700
So now I want to add this event to the logo whenever they click the logo.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,830
I went to get something.

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,380
So I'm going to go right here make some space so we can read it a little bit better and get it started

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,720
with the on camera case because we act and click.

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,040
Now this one.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,180
What I want to do.

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,600
I want to trigger something.

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,050
So I'm going to use the curly braces.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,270
Now I'm going to make use of a fat arrow function.

26
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,740
This is just a function.

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,450
That's what it is.

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,770
Just a function.

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,930
And when the user clicks on something I want to do a console log of I was clicked.

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,050
Simple as that.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Now if I go to the browser and click the logo I get I was clicked.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,830
And if I click it again of course I'm going to get it several times.

33
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,790
So ok that works.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,200
So this fat Aro function is just like a reference to the same function we have inside.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,210
It's like writing a function that calls click.

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,630
And then of course if we call it we call it in one one point of the application it's going to get triggered

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,470
with the consul lock inside.

38
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,600
Now same thing let me go back.

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,460
So now what I want to do instead of us just triggering the function right here.

40
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,270
I want to go first I want to show you some magic.

41
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,070
Is this ESX magic.

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,170
If you have a fat Aro function and we have only a single expression just like here with one log.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,740
In this case we can get rid of the curly braces and this is still going to work.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,460
He has six magic power.

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,920
OK.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,750
So that's fine.

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:32,870
Let's go to the next part what I want to do instead of just triggering this function right here.

48
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,680
I want to pass a reference to a function.

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,630
I don't want to trigger it here.

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,550
I want to have a different function inside of the class and trigger that function.

51
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,390
Whenever we do the unclick.

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,140
OK.

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,640
So I'm going to delete all of this.

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,870
We're not going to need it.

55
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,710
So what I want to do I want to pass a reference to a function.

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,290
So first I'm going to create my function I'm going to say input and then change.

57
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,050
Now then this is a convention.

58
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,280
A lot of people use handler for this whenever they use an event they use handler as a keyword.

59
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,520
And again it's a convention if you want to skip this.

60
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,050
That's good.

61
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,990
I'm just going to leave it.

62
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,280
So whenever we call this function we want to console log console clock and we do.

63
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,240
I was correct.

64
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,500
Simple as that.

65
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,700
So now what we need to do we need to pass a reference inside the unclick to this outside function.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,400
And notice that this function it's inside of the class.

67
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:37,200
So if I do input handler just like that it's not going to work.

68
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,280
It says impot change handler.

69
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,670
It's not mine.

70
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,830
So the thing is that whenever we use a function we need to invoke a function.

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,120
We need to pass the where this function is going to be inside the component inside the class.

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,430
So to make a reference to it we need to say this.

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,650
This means declasse.

74
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,980
So it's going to say this.

75
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,790
The class and it's going to enter class and try to find the function that calls input and input change

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,300
handler.

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
That's what's what's happening right here.

78
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
So I'm going to save it and I'm going to test it.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Now if I click we get I was click.

80
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,280
That's very good.

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,380
You know same thing same result.

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,990
So now the thing is that we need to do this inside of the of the input not the logo.

83
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,800
So I'm going to delete the on click on the logo and I'm going to just go back what we want to do.

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,950
Our goal is to get whatever the user types inside the input.

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,300
So OK I'm going to go right here and I'm going to call the imp in the onchange.

86
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,340
It's going to be on change.

87
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,690
It's going to be a different event.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,710
Not unclick but on change.

89
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,680
So now we need a function that is going to be catching the values.

90
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,260
OK.

91
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,580
So instead of input a click could be interchanged just like here.

92
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,700
So we're going to make a reference to this function.

93
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,940
It's going to be this dot and imprint input change handler.

94
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,890
That's good.

95
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,010
And if I say I was changed that makes more sense.

96
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,100
It type something and we get I was changed.

97
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,420
And if I keep typing things every time we enter or we change the input we get the event that's good.

98
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:25,550
So now what we need to do we need to pass the actual events so we can get the value just like vanilla

99
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,420
jazz.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,110
So whenever we use an event by default we have the event right here.

101
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:38,610
So if I go around here and say event the first argument it's going to be the actual events event.

102
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,580
Now if I do cancel logged in the event we're going to get a lot of things.

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,750
So all of this does an event.

104
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,360
So I'm going to type Panay and we can get an object and this are all the events that we have available

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,210
for us to use.

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,420
Now the thing is that whenever we type something we need to get the value of what the user is typing.

107
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,740
And this is going to be inside event and target.

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,810
You can go right here.

109
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:16,230
So we have the event and we're going to say Dot target dot and then value just like Nilgiris and I get

110
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,590
to say and we get a f. we get F..

111
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:28,090
Let me type Francis and you know for each each word each character you're getting a council.

112
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,530
So you know that's working.

113
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,200
That works really nice.

114
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,380
So this aren't events but this are not the usual events.

115
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:44,720
We know this art called synthetic synthetic events and they are from react Mikko's right here and again

116
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:53,720
to say re-act than darks and then events and we get it right here synthetic event.

117
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,040
So this events are from react.

118
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,590
React is handling the events for us and not the actual browser just like we did in the past.

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,510
So if we go we scroll a little bit down we can have supported events and right here you can have a list

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,010
of all the events in this case keyboard events form events whatever events you can think of.

121
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,660
They just have it so you can check the docs and inspect a little bit of this documentation and know

122
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,890
which events you can get and maybe you can play a little bit with these events on the document.

123
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,910
You can do that.

124
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,620
OK.

125
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,190
So I'm going to just possibly DIOSA.

126
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,090
I'm going to go get a coffee.

127
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,510
Come right back and I will I will suggest you do the same thing.

128
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:46,550
I'm going to be talking about two three or four minutes about something that most people get complicated

129
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,110
with this most of the people get confused with this.

130
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,700
So what possibly deal and be right back.

131
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,100
Right.

132
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,110
So I want to talk about a few things.

133
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,450
I've made some courses not just to you to me but in my country and other places and pretty much all

134
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,760
students have the same question.

135
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,990
And this has got to do with the usage of this right here this so I'm going to start explaining some

136
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,510
Thanks and this are not related to react to this more as five or six related.

137
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,600
So if you're a master of javascript you can move along.

138
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,460
No problem.

139
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,190
If not just please please stay and watch this if not later.

140
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,660
You're going to have some problems.

141
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm going to get confused with some things because of course it is.

142
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,030
It is really confusing.

143
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,130
So first I'm going to change the input change handler.

144
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,610
I'm going to give you an example.

145
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,420
Just going to come in the console lock and we're going to say cancel that log and then I went to get

146
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,000
a hey whenever I type something.

147
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,770
So if I go right here to our application I'm going to type something and we get hey several times that

148
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,830
you know that that works.

149
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:01,610
Now instead of doing that I'm going to go to the project right now and I'm going to add this I to add

150
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,450
parentheses.

151
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,000
So this is pretty much the same thing.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,090
We are just invoking the function Simpang.

153
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,710
So if I go right here let me reload the page.

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,020
You know we are not typing anything but we're still getting Hey whenever the page loads.

155
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,990
So a lot is happening now whenever we use it like this we add the parentheses.

156
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,450
We are practically saying to react that whenever you render this this section this piece of code I want

157
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,040
you to immediately run this function.

158
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,590
So that's why whenever we remove this we are just making a reference to this function and not triggering

159
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,450
the onchange it's calling the function for us.

160
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,360
OK.

161
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,820
Now let me go right here and put the parenthesis.

162
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,360
So in theory if we just trigger the function I'm going to say cancel log on come in this one and we

163
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,910
need to cancel the event.

164
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,310
The target that Bhante.

165
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,070
And you know if it's empty we are not passing anything it's empty.

166
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,300
The target the value should be empty but now we're going to get cannot read properly target undefined

167
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:18,960
The thing is that whenever we don't have the parenthesis the on change it's binding the event to this

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,540
function.

169
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,810
So we have the event available because the onchange is doing this for us.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,070
But whenever we trigger the function manually We didn't have any events.

171
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,790
It's the the arguments right here are empty.

172
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,000
So this event doesn't exist.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,540
So you're calling to write here to a property that doesn't exist so we can be get can we property target

174
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,410
of undefined.

175
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,420
You know Diwan use undefined.

176
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,880
So how can we fix this.

177
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,520
So this is going to look really really weird going to put it right here because it's a little bit long

178
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,650
one second ago.

179
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,400
So how can we fix this.

180
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm going to put a space and I'm going to pass a fat R-OH function.

181
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,980
This fact our function is going to have the arguments of the event and then when I call the function

182
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,210
I'm going to pass the event right here.

183
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,810
OK so let me come with the console OK let's try again.

184
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm going to type Francis and you know it works.

185
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,680
It's still working.

186
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,380
So how can this work.

187
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,120
And the other thing too.

188
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,030
Well this is got to do with with nested functions it's more.

189
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,270
Yes.

190
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
Five or six.

191
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Let me give you an example with the S-5.

192
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,140
You can get a real really quick.

193
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,940
First I'm going to have a function that is going to be one function one whatever.

194
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,280
So the one is going to take the argument of a name going to be passing a name to this function then

195
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,390
you're going to have function to add this function to it's going to have the same arguments.

196
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,480
And then what I want to do I want to trigger the function to pass a name.

197
00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:00,210
So this function instead of doing the console log isn't going to call the function one and it's going

198
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,750
to pass.

199
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,020
The name argument which is going to be Frances and now of the function one it's in charge of doing the

200
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,090
console log.

201
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,570
So I'm going to say cancel a log and then just name.

202
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,530
If I reload the page we get Francis so that it's working.

203
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,020
You know real simple this is.

204
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,630
Yes fine.

205
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,420
Very good.

206
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,180
So the same thing is happening right here.

207
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,530
Whenever we call the unchanged disk on change it's calling to a function.

208
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,770
The first function right here and it's passing the event as an argument and this function it's calling

209
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,630
a different function and it's passing the event right here.

210
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,200
You know this is the.

211
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,180
Right here the two it's the this one outside and this one is the function one.

212
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,630
So whenever we call this we pass the end with that we have on the on the function to that we get from

213
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,370
the change.

214
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,100
And this of course works now.

215
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,310
Same thing.

216
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,980
It works really good.

217
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,740
So OK that's the problem.

218
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,450
You know it it's not that hard when you see it like this with the S-5 But just like this.

219
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,570
All trimmed.

220
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,240
It's get a little bit hard to understand.

221
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,210
Let's get up let's get we have a few more weird things with this.

222
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:20,100
At some point of course you can see something that says bind this but we're not there yet.

223
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,750
We're going to begin to do something else with buying this.

224
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,320
OK.

225
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,690
Whenever we get to that problem I would explain why we're doing by buying this and why we are not doing

226
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,160
bind this.

227
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,730
So let's keep moving forward on the next section.

228
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,410
We're going to be talking about the six constructor.

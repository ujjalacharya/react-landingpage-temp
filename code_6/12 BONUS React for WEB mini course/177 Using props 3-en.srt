1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,570
OK so we are rendering all the items.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:10,090
But the thing is that we have one component right here use list item that needs to grab this information

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,780
and show each news each post.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,640
So we need to do that right now.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,870
First we don't have anything inside news list items so we need to create a component for this.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,110
So first I'm going to do import I'm sorry import react.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,170
Yes react from.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,740
And then of course we need to bring it from react right go.

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,900
So now we're going to create a functional component because we don't need classes right here.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,510
We don't need to state it's going to be Konst.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,430
And then of course it's going to be equal to news something that makes sense.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,470
News item.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,060
OK.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,670
So this news item is going to be equal to a function just like this and this function is going to be

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,900
rendering something.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,040
So we're going to say render Oh sorry not render return.

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,850
So this news item is going to receive the props that begin to be passing from the parent component which

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,590
is going to be on your list.

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,790
So this return for now is going to be just death.

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,470
And what I want to do I want to console log the prompts that we're going to pass just to check that

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,600
everything works OK.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,510
OK.

23
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,460
So now we need to make this component available from other components.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,510
So we're going to say export the font and then news item.

25
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,030
So this one it's kind of a rating right now.

26
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,200
So we need to import this useless item inside here inside US list.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,730
OK.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,210
So I'm going to bring it just like we did before.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,790
I'm going to say import and the name was news news item and we're going to bring this one from from.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,360
And then we're going to bring it from Dot.

31
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,940
Forward slash and use this item just like that.

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,360
So now instead of passing this I'm just going to cut this and paste it right here at the bottom and

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,790
common this out to be going to be using it later.

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,290
So instead of passing some data what I can do I can make a reference we can make a reference to this

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,960
new list item and we can pass on each iteration the actual item.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,060
So are going to be returning one single element on each iteration.

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,330
So we're going to go right here and we're going to say news item.

38
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,360
Okay.

39
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,300
Let me close it like this.

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,990
So this news item is going to go to the news list.

41
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,460
It's going to for example read the first iteration.

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,140
It's going to go to a news item.

43
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,130
It's going to go to this file and it's going to pass it as props.

44
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:56,260
So if we look a lot of the props we can see that we have four different objects so we calling it four

45
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,760
times.

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,290
No we are constantly we are doing the console of Propst But of course Propst it's still empty.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,780
So if we go back to the news this can pass the props.

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,240
Now we can choose whatever name we wish to say item makes sense.

49
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,560
The item is going to be equal to item just like this.

50
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,420
So now this news item this item is going to be inside props.

51
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:27,610
So we check props we have four different props on four different iterations and on each one we have

52
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,340
different data.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,220
First one is going to be the ID number one two three and four.

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,540
Okay that's good.

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,170
So now what we can do we can grab this this inside Propst and we can make a reference to what we are

56
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,060
whenever we're doing great here at the bottom.

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:50,170
You know we are exporting we are rendering some templates so it can get cut and paste it inside the

58
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,790
return.

59
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,790
Make this a little bit nicer.

60
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,430
So now we're going to get an error message fades Kampar item it's not fine.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,530
And it's because item it is not defined item.

62
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,620
It's not inside item.

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,690
We're not using a map right here.

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,730
You're just passing the data inside prompts.

65
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:17,860
So what we need to do we need to make first a reference to Propst and then item and then again prompts

66
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:26,560
that item and it's going to reload the page a few seconds on the Internet it's a little bit slow.

67
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,740
And OK we're getting it.

68
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,060
OK that's good.

69
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,430
So now we're going to get a different error message and begin I'm sorry.

70
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,250
Let's go back.

71
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,110
We can make this a little bit better.

72
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,390
Instead of using prompts when I can do I can bring the item and instead of doing prompts that item you

73
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,350
can say like before item and it's still going to work.

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,010
So what is happening right here what what I'm doing.

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,360
So this is going to be ESX is going to be called.

76
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,930
It's called destructuring.

77
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,920
It's the same idea that we're doing right here at the top beer we have access to a big object and we

78
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,990
are say OK I did from that big object.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,420
We only need components so bring me components.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,420
So we're doing the same thing right here from prop's which is the argument that we're getting.

81
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,460
I want to just get the item and right here we make a reference to that same idea.

82
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,060
OK.

83
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:29,890
So we got an error message is going to say each child in array or iterator should have a unique key

84
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,320
or Propp.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,700
Now this is from re-act now.

86
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:40,990
Whenever you work with a map or maybe some iterator oil Luper or whatever you want to call it you need

87
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,220
to pass a key on each element on each iteration.

88
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,560
If you return this element this element needs to have a key.

89
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,050
Now a key is going to be an ID.

90
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,740
And this from react.

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,410
You can pass whatever key you wish as long as this is not repeated.

92
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:06,880
So I'm going to say key and it's going to be equal to and then curly braces if you remember inside to

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,270
give you the Jasen for each news each post.

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,940
We have a different ID.

95
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,550
One two three and four.

96
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,670
So what we can do we can pass the key of that.

97
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:26,200
So we are going to say item that ID and the error goes away a little bit slow today.

98
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,650
OK the error goes away.

99
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,620
Let's get.

100
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,050
So remember to always add the key if not react is going to is going to give you that error message.

101
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,680
OK.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,910
So that's good.

103
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,050
So let's go to the next section.

104
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,400
I want to talk about something else that is kind of related to props.

105
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,280
Let's go.

106
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,870
Let's go to the next section and talk about the children of props.

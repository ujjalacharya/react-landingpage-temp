1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,280
All right so we have one more we can use.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:10,430
It's going to be a custom custom prop type are going to be I'm going to be using the mother promp I'm

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,260
going to delete everything inside.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,460
I'm going to create a custom function that is going to be checking.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,870
So first we need to create a function.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,140
OK.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,290
Just a function.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,880
So this function with Propp types is going to be getting three different arguments.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,830
First is going to be it's going to be Propst then begin to be receiving the props and the name this

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,040
case it's proper name and then coma and then the component name is.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,240
These are the arguments that we get by default.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,530
So just to check what we're getting I'm going to say console log and are going to be canceling doing

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,020
the console log on with prompts.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,810
So OK so if we cancel all the prompts you're getting the props.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,390
Let's get if I do it grab the prop name we get the name.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,020
In this case it's going to be mother.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,550
It's the name of the prom that we are checking.

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,970
And if we put the component name of course we get the component name makes sense.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:14,680
So right now Mother it's given back just a string with the name Martha.

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,750
So what we can do we can check for something since we have the access to the value we can check for

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,280
that.

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,910
So I'm going to I'm going to write just an if statement something real simple and first are going to

23
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,440
be ugly.

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,680
Grab the props which is the actual object the actual array and are going to be accessing the product

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,280
name which in this case is going to be mother.

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:42,140
So this is going to access the mother and it's going to be checking the values we have access to the

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,640
value what we can do.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,050
We can check for us for things.

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,570
So I'm going to say if this value is not equal to Jane we're going to give back an error message.

30
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,350
So I'm going to say cancel log and then no that's good.

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,680
So if I reload the application I'm getting no.

32
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,500
And that's good because as value of mother I have Martha.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,210
So you know should I be working.

34
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,980
So if I say Jane if I correct this we're going to because it's going to pass.

35
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,060
Let's get so now right here.

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,130
Something else what we can do we can return our own custom error message.

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:27,080
So I'm going to say return just like that and then knew and then error and this one again I can pass

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,130
right here whatever I want.

39
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,680
In this case just going to pass.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
Attempt to strings.

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,620
I'm going to say the name.

42
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:42,350
And then of course I'm going to make a reference to props and then prop name just like that prop some

43
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,200
prop name and then I'm going to ride is incorrect should be.

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,430
And then Jane says we have Jane right now is going to pass.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:02,090
But if I change it back to Martha just like this is going to give us our custom our message didn't Martha

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,560
Martha is incorrect.

47
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,030
Should be Jane.

48
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,800
So this is a way where you can use you can write your own custom messages and of course it always depends.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,950
Depends on what you want to do or which kind of a message you want to output you have to have a lot

50
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,280
of more options for this going to go to the browser and I'm going to go to and be NPM J.S. and then

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,330
package and then prop types you know is the NPM Web site and then we're going to go to these to these

52
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,210
pensee.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,350
So you know you have a lot of more options right here.

54
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,280
You can check things is going to give you the the information of what you can do you can change.

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,050
We we would you just covered most of them.

56
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,140
You know the most used prop types.

57
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,730
So let's go.

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,120
OK.

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,430
That's good let's keep moving to the next topic we're going to be talking about something else completely

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,390
different topic.

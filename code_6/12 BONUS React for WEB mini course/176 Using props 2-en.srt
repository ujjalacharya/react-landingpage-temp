1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,450
All right.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:07,480
So now we have the data inside props and that news and this is going to be an array of objects.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,960
So now we need a way to loop this array of objects coming from props and display data right here.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,080
So first I'm going to just remove this from here.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,720
I'm just going to say items for now.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,510
And OK I'm going to go right here at the top and it can create a viable that is going to be called items.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,200
So this verbal is going to be looping whatever information we get from prop's the news.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,720
So I'm going to first begin to be X accessing prop's then we're going to say Dot and I'm going to access

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,380
news because you know the data it's inside there.

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,810
And then since we have an array of objects are going to be using map and you're going to be using map

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,410
the whole time.

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,040
This could be your best friend.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,920
So OK.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,240
So now what we need to do we need to pass whatever we want to loop which is this.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,050
And in each iteration we're going to pass an item.

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,590
Now I'm going to say item.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,690
Now if you have a news pleural where you can say is new or whatever but you know there's no Singler

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,430
of news.

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,860
So for now I'm going to say item and this this is going to be an anonymous function.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:29,990
Now on each iteration that on each key that we find inside prop's news each object begin to run an iteration.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,120
If we check the Jason Jason that we have right here we have four different news.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,930
So this loop is going to loop four times and in each iteration is get it past the item.

23
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,010
The first iteration is going to pass the first one.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,030
The second one the third two is one and the other one this one and this going to this is going to be

25
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,580
ESX.

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,190
This is not react.

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,440
So now on each direction we pass the item.

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:02,170
So what we can do we can return some GSX going to say return opening close just like that.

29
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,730
So now inside the return remember that whenever we use data sets we need to pass a single element.

30
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,570
And this one is going to be each item of news.

31
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,650
So first thing going to add a title the title it needs a title.

32
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,410
If we go to the DVD that Jason we have the title right here.

33
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,110
OK.

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,530
I'm going to go right here and bring the title now.

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,750
On each iteration we have each element inside item.

36
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,400
So what we can do we can say item dot and then title just like that.

37
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,260
And if we go right here of course we're not getting anything.

38
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,610
So now what do we need to do is to pass the feed.

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,890
So I'm going to create a viable that is going to be I'm sorry a div that is going to pass the actual

40
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,480
feed.

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,840
So I'm going to say item and then feed.

42
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,110
OK.

43
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,020
Of course nothing is going to happen.

44
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:00,480
So now this Barville is doing all the logic rendering some markup with the title and the feed.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,070
This is what we need.

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,530
So now what we can do inside the return we can make a reference to this Vrable.

47
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,400
So we're going to go right here and enclose everything inside curly braces.

48
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,450
OK.

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,180
And re-act is going to do the job for us is going to notice that we have something that calls items

50
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:27,140
is going to find the items and this item it's items this verbal it's returning some GSX So it's going

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,680
to go and paste and put the GSX inside here.

52
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,080
You know it works.

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,960
Everything works really nice.

54
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:41,680
So this map again it's C-s ESX and it's kind of doing kind of a for loop.

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,590
It's actually a loop of course but it's kind of a doing I equals zero if you come from the yes world

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,920
than I is less than our array that lang.

57
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:59,450
You know all the logic that we used to do back in the day plus plus And then inside begin to access

58
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,820
each array.

59
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,310
And then of course we passed the iteration and then we passed the item.

60
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,500
And in this case we wanted to get the title we say title.

61
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,260
So this is the same logic than this one.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,120
You're not going to use that you're going to be using iOS 6 because iOS 6 is awesome and begin to be

63
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,790
using it the whole time.

64
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,930
OK so this works we still need to do a few things.

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:32,090
If you remember we are using news list item so this should be rendered inside use list item on each

66
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,160
item.

67
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:39,860
So let's go to the next section and see how to include that include this code inside news list item.

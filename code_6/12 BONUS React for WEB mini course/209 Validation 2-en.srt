1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,920
OK so now we're going to be doing is going to be adding a new validation rule for this so we can you

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,460
know just add more rules on the same statement.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,590
So are going to go right here to users.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,960
And what I want to do I want to add a rule that it's going to be checking if we have more than five

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:24,110
characters so are going to do coma and I'm going to do an ad men land something like that you can call

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,700
it whatever you want and I want to get at least more than five characters.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,290
OK.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,270
So now we have a rule for this how can we you know check add a rule for this piece of code.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,960
Again right here we haven't.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,620
We have a function that is going to be checking all the rules and do something if we have something.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,260
So you know we can add the rules right here.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,230
We're going to go right here at the bottom.

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,510
They're going to be adding the rule and if you remember he was called Mean lenge.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,500
So I'm going to say if open it close and if element validation and I'm of course going to change require

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,930
and then we do mean lenth we want to run some code.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,530
So first we need to check if this is valid.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,260
So it's going to be valid it's going to be equal to something are going to be assaye accessing the elements

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,940
that value dot and then the Lang because of course we want to check how many letters we have how many

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,150
characters.

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,180
And this one needs to be greater or equal than something and that something is going to be this number.

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,020
So again we just access that.

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:37,290
It's going to be elements darte then validation that and then mean Len.

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,140
So now this one is going to be true or false depending on what we have in the closet.

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,120
And then we need to add the message so it's going to be message it's going to be equal then.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,470
And I'm just going to copy the one we have at the bottom so we can spare some time.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:00,350
So if it's not valid we're going to be adding a message she's going to be must be greater than and and

27
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:07,190
going to be a plus and then make a reference to these elements validation mingling and of course if

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,860
we don't have an error message it's not going to pass anything.

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:19,550
OK so now we need to return the error and the validation message is going to copy and paste it and then

30
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,270
that is all.

31
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,530
So let's check it.

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,710
If I type enough we're going to get a message must be greater than 5 5.

33
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,560
Keep typing things is going to go away because we have more than five.

34
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,630
And if I delete some we have less than five so we get the error message.

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,190
So you know that can work.

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,270
And there's one problem right here.

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,980
Let's go back to reload the application now.

38
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:52,320
If I type of character just like why I'm instantly getting must be greater than five.

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,850
So it would be good if we get this error message whenever we do the on Blur's.

40
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,080
You know whenever we focus on a different place and if we are right here you're typing and I go out

41
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,390
and this is not valid.

42
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,320
Then I should be getting the error message and not before that.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,420
That's why inside user we have touched property so we can create something that is going to be changing

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,280
that touched to True or false depending if we deal with it on blur.

45
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,680
And you know that kind of stuff.

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,020
OK.

47
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,780
So let's begin this.

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,770
First we need an event listener that is going to be listening if we you know we focus out and that of

49
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,390
course is going to be called on blur.

50
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,810
We didn't have that function.

51
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,680
So this blur what it's going to be doing is going to be just running the same function we have right

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,440
here whenever we do we move outside.

53
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,960
It's going to run this function.

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,070
You're going to see in a minute why so right here going to be passing a new action right here that is

55
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,810
going to be triggering the same thing.

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,630
OK so I'm going to say on blur.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,150
This is not the end listener.

58
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,040
This is just a prop.

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,580
It's going to be doing the same thing that we do on change.

60
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,570
OK.

61
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,220
Paste it down there.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,610
So now right here if you go to form fields we didn't have something that listens for that on Blar on

63
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,780
Blar listener so I'm going to go right here.

64
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,560
I'm going to be adding this on blur.

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,170
It's going to be a mistake.

66
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,960
This is the correct one and this is the re-act event listener right.

67
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,860
So this on blur what it's going to be doing is going to be triggering the change handler whenever we

68
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,670
focus out of this input.

69
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,830
So again we just copy the same thing we're going to be running the same function and we have one problem.

70
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:53,330
Whenever we we do the ampler we focus out that elements we need to tell the new state that the state

71
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,790
that we're going to be updating to.

72
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,340
We need to tell it to tell if this blur right.

73
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,030
Here is this property right here.

74
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,640
The touch should be false or true you know.

75
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,230
So right here whenever we are triggered this we need to say true.

76
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,640
And then this one we need to say forms.

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,610
It's not going to be passing a third argument.

78
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,740
This one is going to be true.

79
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,690
True.

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,930
And the other one is going to be false.

81
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,810
So this could be could do this you know many many different ways.

82
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,520
When we hit the the second part of the NBA project we're going to change a little bit of this is going

83
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,170
to change it a little bit.

84
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,460
OK.

85
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,800
So when whenever we have an umpire we're going to run the change handler and begin to pass a third argument.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,490
So I'm gonna go right here at the top and we're going to be changing this function.

87
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,950
So this change handler now is going to get a third argument.

88
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,130
It's going to be the blur which is going to be true or false.

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,140
And we only want to validate whenever blur.

90
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,590
It's equal to true.

91
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,000
You know if it's true it means that we did the on focus and we want to do something.

92
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,970
So I'm going to say if blur than we want to run the validation.

93
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,590
All right.

94
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,090
Now this blur is going to be always changing.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:25,820
So I need to pass news to access in you state of this element and change that touched property we have

96
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,940
right here because after we do the focus out this touch it's to go to true.

97
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,140
So this could be a blur or that could be true.

98
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,370
Doesn't matter for now.

99
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,730
For now I'm just going to put a player that's fine.

100
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,350
So I'm going to save it and I'm going to just check checking this.

101
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,680
I'm going to answer here.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,970
I'm going to stop typing.

103
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,680
You know we're not getting the error message.

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,330
Now if I focus out we get the error message and if I keep typing you know and focus out it's going to

105
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,670
be it's going to go to true.

106
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,770
So this one is going to be called true.

107
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,590
You can just check that we get the same thing.

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,100
If I focus out we get the message and the fight type something you know I'm not getting the error message.

109
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,600
If I focus out we get the error message.

110
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,840
So you know this is can working.

111
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,840
That's the main idea of having that touched property.

112
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,750
OK so we are pretty much done.

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,990
So we need to get the last thing we need to do is to check the the information in the form it's valid

114
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,520
before we submit.

115
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,240
Because if I type for example just to this one it's an error and I typed the other ones and actually

116
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,760
passed them values and now I do SIFF med I'm going to get you know the values and the name.

117
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,030
It's not correct it's not valid but it's still submitting devalues this council log.

118
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,790
It's coming from a sieve for data to submit.

119
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,270
So we need to do something right here to check on the state.

120
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,620
If all the inputs are valid and if we're going to be looping all the inputs inside the state and we

121
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,660
need to check if they have a property of valid true.

122
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:14,000
Now all of the elements we didn't have the ballot property so we need to add at least now we are going

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,700
to be requiring at least the required falles validation.

124
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,740
It's going to be copping this one and I'm going to be changing this one too.

125
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,750
True.

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,180
This one is the last name.

127
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,590
Going to make this required and valid.

128
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,220
It's going to be false.

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,290
They're going to be copying everything else over here.

130
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,860
The message is going to be koma validation.

131
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,730
It's going to be required true and I'm going to copy this one as well and it's going to be required.

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,790
I'm not going to make this one required.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,600
And right from the start this one it's valid because we don't require validation and the same thing

134
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,590
with the with the select right.

135
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,480
We make this nice.

136
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,750
OK.

137
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,860
So now whenever we submit what we need to do right now we have all empty.

138
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,150
So this one it's not good.

139
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
This one and this one are not valid.

140
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:14,150
So we need to do some checking right here to check if we have the value prop the value true inside all

141
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,740
of this right now from the start.

142
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,160
This one the last name and the name are false.

143
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,980
So this shouldn't be submitting.

144
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,270
OK.

145
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,990
So let's go to submit form and I'm just going to do this at the top right here.

146
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,760
So now what do we need to do.

147
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,990
We have the data to submit and we need to check before that if that does that state that form has the

148
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,160
property value valid true inside all of the inputs.

149
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,370
So I'm going to do a for just like we did before.

150
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,430
So for let key.

151
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,560
Same thing with it at the top.

152
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,910
And this state that formed data.

153
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,860
OK.

154
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,570
Once we are inside here we want to check if the form is valid.

155
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,530
So I got to create a new viral that is going to host of Boullion.

156
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,830
So it's going to be form is valid just like that.

157
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,960
So this one is going to be equal to true or it's going to be equal to false.

158
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,010
Right from the start when whenever we submit the form it's going to be true but if it something happens

159
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,680
right here it's going to be changed to falls and we are not going to submit it.

160
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,860
So inside the form are going to be accessing this form valid and they're going to do some checking right

161
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,610
here.

162
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,980
So what I want to check is does not state that form data.

163
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:46,140
And then we check each key on each iteration and we check if it's valid.

164
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:53,010
So if this one this key has the valid of true this form ballot it's going to be true.

165
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,130
If not it's going to be false and then are going to be adding one more rule.

166
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,700
We want to check if the form is valid.

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
OK.

168
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,180
So no this this one it's false formatted it's going to be false.

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
So we are not going to submit.

170
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:18,990
So I'm going to say if opening close and I'm going to be checking for Malad and if we do have a valid

171
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,270
form I'm going to be doing the console log.

172
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,770
All right.

173
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,170
Going to save this.

174
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,160
OK.

175
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,330
That's a test.

176
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,320
You know this should be at or are going to be adding a name.

177
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,180
You know I'm going to enter the wrong name of this impot it's not valid.

178
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,410
I'm going to do last name which is you know JONES And you know a message of hello this one.

179
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,520
It's not required.

180
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,380
And then I'm going to be adding an age.

181
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,260
So now if I submit nothing happens I'm not getting a console log.

182
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,870
So that is good.

183
00:11:52,140 --> 00:12:00,960
So what happens if I put the correct information and I submit I get the data that we need to post.

184
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,260
All right.

185
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,760
So you know that is that that is working.

186
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,420
All right.

187
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,510
So this is it.

188
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:13,680
You know this is all we're going to be doing pretty much the same thing on the NBA project begin to

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,510
be adding users on a database.

190
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,580
They're going to be doing a log in and we're going to be entering data inside a real database not the

191
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,180
Jason server and we're going to be using a template just like this to you know to enter the information

192
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,270
to create inputs and to validate everything.

193
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,750
But we're going to be doing it on a different way we're going to be changing this a little bit.

194
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,620
So if you think about it what is the downside of this.

195
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,340
You know this logic.

196
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,220
So right here.

197
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,910
Calling to form fields and form fields is entering this state and generating all the inputs.

198
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,860
What happens if this form we need to have some text between last name and message.

199
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,550
I cannot add it because form fields is just rendering all the inputs in a list.

200
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,230
So I cannot just chop this down and put some text in the middle.

201
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,350
We can use this way just to render all the impetus we have in the list.

202
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,830
We cannot add anything in the middle on the MBA project begin to be doing something else instead of

203
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,930
rendering all the fields inside of different components.

204
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,540
You're just going to call to an input feel that has some property and this one is going to be in charge

205
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
of rendering won input.

206
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,560
We're going to do that you know before that we need to discuss a lot of things.

207
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,910
So in the next sections we're going to be talking about firebase you're going to be going to be talking

208
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,440
about how to authenticate users how to log in and how to log out.

209
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:59,460
We're going to be adding all the data we're going to be adding data inside a database and once we know

210
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:06,120
how to work with firebase we can grab that NBA project we're going to add firebase and we're going to

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,860
be adding users log in log out.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,300
We can to create a backhand you know a dashboard of register user so we can add a new post.

213
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,660
So we're going to be doing that.

214
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,320
So let's go to the next section and start with firebase.

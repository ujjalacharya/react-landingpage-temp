1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:00,930
Right.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,000
So before we move to the next generation I want to show you how we can achieve the same the same behavior

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,680
and not to do inline styling to use classes.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,460
So first I'm going to lead all of this to delete this one because we're not going to use it and we're

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,260
going to be adding just a simple div with a class code to delete all of this as well.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,720
And for now I'm going to delete the state.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,860
So now what we can do is we have the state available what we can do we can as a class name and the class

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,770
name we're going to be adding our custom class but we're going to be using the state as well.

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,140
So first I'm going to give a name to this to my to my component and make my div I'm going to give a

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,990
class and again and call you know square mixdowns square the square or not.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,720
And then of course I'm going to repeat the same thing I'm going to say Square but now what I will need

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,360
to do only to add the state of whatever state we get right here.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,570
So are going to be using template strings and going to be adding the state.

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:08,370
So now whenever we the transition is going to be entering this or exiting this we get the class of a

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,040
level inside class name.

16
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,140
So I'm going to do the same thing right here.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,570
Just get a copy of this and paste it right here so we can see inside the div which classes we are getting.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,480
So OK.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,470
So we have square and square enter.

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,830
This is the first state going to click.

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,040
It's going to say Square exiting and square exit.

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,800
And if I click again we get you know entering and then enter.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,170
So we're getting the classes right here.

24
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,640
And inside the class name of course we get the class on the inspect just to make sure.

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,930
And to make this a little bit bigger.

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,160
And I'm going to go go right here and you know we have square square entered.

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,790
And if I click it square exiting and exited and then entering and entered.

28
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,300
So we are getting the classes.

29
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,440
So the only thing that we need to do right now is to add the the CSSA for this.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,010
OK.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,670
So got to go to APS-C SS and they have three different transitions and this one is going to be the basic.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,850
So going to be adding the classes right now.

33
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,860
Real simple.

34
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,640
The first one is going to be called Square and square.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:24,110
If you remember we have a background off read what else we have the height of 100 pixels.

36
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:24,810
What else.

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,170
We have the capacity since this is the main state of the def is going to be one.

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:37,120
And then of course we need to add the transmission and the transmission is going to be all then two

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,160
seconds of course and then ease.

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,050
You know this is just an assessment.

41
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,640
Nothing.

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,120
It's not react or javascript.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,390
Good.

44
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:53,530
So now we have the main state of this the next state is going to be entering then the entered and then

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,260
the exiting and then the exit.

46
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,790
So I get to say Square.

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,890
Just like before.

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,070
And again to be adding a class A square entering.

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,950
So it is going to be square and then entering and this class is going to be doing the animation of when

50
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,260
the device is going to be entering.

51
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,080
So we're going to be doing opacity just like that and it's going to be equal to one and it could be

52
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:24,130
adding one more thing to add a transform and it's going to be translate and translate X and we get a

53
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,360
good zero percent.

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,650
So now I'm going to do the same thing but with the square entered it's going to say square dot and square

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,420
and then entered and are going to be change in the background to blue so we can see that transition.

56
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,830
So first the the element is not visible.

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,910
It's going to have a visit I'm sorry it's visible is right here we can see it right here with you.

58
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,040
Has it your one and after the element enters.

59
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,930
And we get the state is going to be changing the color from red to blue.

60
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,750
So now we need to do the exit state.

61
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:11,110
So it's going to be square then Square and it's going to be exiting and going to be change in the background

62
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,130
to green.

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,990
And of course again I need to do the accident which is going to be the translite and the opacity and

64
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:29,350
of course is going to be the same idea so square and then square and it's going to be it looks like

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,030
that open close.

66
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,540
We get a pass city and you pass it is going to be zero and we're going to be removing the element from

67
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,250
the queen is going to be sliding to the left.

68
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,780
So we're going to be using transform and the same translate X but this time is going to be minus 100

69
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,570
percent.

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,800
So it's going to be hiding.

71
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,670
Hold it.

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,460
OK.

73
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,320
So in theory this should be working good.

74
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,680
So we're going to be reloading the application now.

75
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,970
We get square entered and enter it's going to be a positive one and the color blue.

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,330
If I click it it's going to be changing to green and it's going to remove the different screen.

77
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,820
And you know exiting.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,210
And when we get X it is going to be moving so it's going to work.

79
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,510
If I click on show or hide again it's going to be doing and then change the color when we get to enter.

80
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,100
So you know it's working good.

81
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,590
It's just one more time.

82
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,490
OK.

83
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,090
It works.

84
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,300
So you know it's really simple once you get the idea of how this works with this state means what we

85
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,740
can do with the state.

86
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,120
It's you know it's really really simple.

87
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,930
So of course we get a lot of more options with this.

88
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:49,040
What we can do we can set the time out for the enter and the exit in separate mode.

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,950
Let me just delete this and I'm going to be adding an object and this object is going to be the enter

90
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,270
which is going to be 200.

91
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,290
Just like that.

92
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,700
And again at the exit.

93
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,000
And this one is going to be shorters going to be 50.

94
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,890
So whenever with the state it's enter or entering it's going to be it's going to be using the timeout

95
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,180
of two seconds.

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,690
And if redoing exiting is going to use half second.

97
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,400
So going to reload the application going to show you know it's a little bit faster.

98
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,130
And if I do it again same thing.

99
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,020
So we can do this.

100
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,840
We have a lot of options available.

101
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,980
You can check the documentation of course.

102
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,370
We have more of course.

103
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,460
I can say Enter it's going to be equal to.

104
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,500
And I'm going to set it to false so we can see the difference.

105
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,920
I can say Exod. and it's going to be equal to false as well.

106
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,360
So I'm going to be reloading the application OK.

107
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,580
So we have entered.

108
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,770
And if I click a show or hide it's just going to do it.

109
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,910
It's not going to go through the exiting option.

110
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:02,330
It's going to just do the entered Micheaux changed as you move reload and click hide.

111
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,920
And if you notice it's just doing the and the accident it's not going through the exiting it's just

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,660
going directly to the ad to the exit going to click again.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,270
And we get it right here.

114
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:22,740
So it's not use it is only using the square entered the state of enter it or exiting or our exit is

115
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,860
not going through exiting or entering.

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,770
So this is the main purpose of this.

117
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,250
And if I do true of course it's going to be using all the states you know the entering and the exiting

118
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,850
exiting.

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,670
And then it's going to go and of course we do the same thing entering and entered.

120
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,130
So this is the main purpose of the enter and the exit.

121
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:51,970
Of course we can do a little bit more or are going to be adding on Antar and it's going to be equal

122
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,890
and it's going to be equal to a function.

123
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:01,030
This function takes takes a note which is going to be the arguments for this and then we can do whatever

124
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,480
we want.

125
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,160
I can say cancel log and then I don't know enter on the brink the council is going to go right here

126
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,630
the Bonhomme and if I click it of course nothing is going to happen.

127
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,730
But if I click it again we should be getting a console log of enter.

128
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,040
You know we get Enter So whenever the element and the div it's entering is going to do is going to be

129
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,770
executing whatever code you have right here.

130
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,740
And of course we have the opposite of this which is going to be on exit.

131
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,000
It's going to be on exit.

132
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:41,600
And same idea this one has a node and it's going to be equal to something.

133
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,130
And I always made a mistake here.

134
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,000
Just deleted.

135
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,260
No there's no mistake.

136
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,650
There we go.

137
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,370
OK.

138
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:01,060
So same thing are going to just copy the console log and it's going to be Exod. something like that.

139
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,660
And if I save it I click show it's going to be hiding.

140
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,030
So we get the exit and if of course we click again we have to enter it.

141
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,640
So this one is never going to be useful for us.

142
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,880
Going to see it later.

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,420
OK.

144
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,730
So everything's good.

145
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,230
Let's go to the next one to see a sister incisions.

146
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,220
And now since you know how this works the main logic of doing all of this.

147
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,160
This ones are going to be real real simple.

148
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,370
Let's go to the next one.

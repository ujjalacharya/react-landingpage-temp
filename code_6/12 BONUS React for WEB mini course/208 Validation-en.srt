1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,460
OK so now we're going to be adding some validation.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,230
And just like we did before we are going to do everything from the template you know that's the main

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,450
idea of doing all of this.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,610
So right from the start.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,820
Each of each item you know each input it's to have inside the manifest you know inside the schema a

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,890
rule for validation.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,200
So I'm going to add a coma and I'm going to say validation and this one is going to be called to you

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,640
know an object.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,690
Now at least we don't need to have the of what we're going to be doing.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,350
You can change this in the future.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,780
You know it's up to you.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,880
We need to have at least one validation that is going to be required.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,530
And this could be either true or it could be either false so if this one is false it's not going to

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,470
validate anything.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,080
But for starters when it's going to be true the name is going to be required good.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,700
So then I'm going to do koma are going to be adding more things are going to be adding a rule for Barlett.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,750
So if this after we do the validation if this impot it's valid we're going to be changing this property

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,410
for now whenever the application start is going to be false.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,620
So then coma we're going to be earning it touched and get it about.

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,710
Talk about this later.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,950
But don't worry just as you just need to add it and then we can have a validation message after we validate

22
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,750
everything.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,720
We're going to check if it's wrong.

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:30,170
And if it's wrong begin to return a message so we can say valley Dacian and then message could be shorter.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,780
But no this name mix makes sense.

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,220
And when the application starts of course this message is going to be empty.

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,080
We don't have an actual message.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,760
OK.

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,930
So this is the the start the starting point begin to validate first the name.

30
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,770
Now the rest of the inputs need to have at least ambulation just like that right here.

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,050
So just get a copy of this validation required and everything else.

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,670
I'm going to paste it on the all the ones I'm going to do koma paste.

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,110
This one you know koma paste.

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,200
And of.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,620
Let's leave the message and the H because first we're going to do the validation inside the template

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,030
so we can test the inputs for now.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,010
So just to make it a little bit faster.

38
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,540
So OK so this one is going to be false.

39
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,430
For now just false.

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,750
And again if we start false we didn't have any rule.

41
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,520
It's going to be valid equals true of course.

42
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,900
OK let's get we're going to just do the inputs first.

43
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:38,450
So now whenever we the application is going to is going to create this input we need to start checking

44
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,360
whenever we add something inside the input.

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
Whenever I type something I want to run the validation and check it.

46
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,570
So if we go to form fields right here we have.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,350
Now we have a function that onchange and we just run the change handler.

48
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,860
So inside change handler we could check the information that we are typing and then just decide if this

49
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,960
information it's correct or not.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,400
No that's the main idea.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,000
OK.

52
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,270
So I'm going to go right here at the top and I'm going to enter the change handler so I'm going to go

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,840
here at the bottom.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,670
And now I need to start checking things first.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,740
I'm going to create a variable that is going to be called valid data there's valid data is going to

56
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,740
be equal to true or it's going to be equal to false or it's going to be equal to something.

57
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,380
So right here I to make a reference to Valley date and this one is going to be a function that is going

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,860
to be checking if this input and the value we have inside it's true or false given the rules that we

59
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,290
have right here.

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,460
So OK so this validate is going to run some checks on this impot for example on the name.

61
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,100
So right from the start is we need to pass which impot we want to check.

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,720
And if you remember we have the information inside new state and Id say if we pass to validate the name

63
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:07,190
and the all the information about that input this Band-Aid is going to receive this input in particular.

64
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,090
And of course then it's going to receive this one and then this one and everything else.

65
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,950
But right now we can focus on this one.

66
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,980
OK so Vulg. is going to be receiving the you know that data we don't have this function.

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,630
We're going to create right now.

68
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,120
So I'm going to say Konst and then Byerly date.

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,820
And this one is going to receive that elements are going to say element.

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,300
And then of course we run a function.

71
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,500
Okay that's good.

72
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:43,310
So first I'm going to do a console log and then elements just like that are going to save it for now

73
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,790
we can get now going into anything.

74
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,920
But if I type f we can get that discount lock elements.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,160
So you know we have the config the element input level and we have touch and valid and everything else.

76
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,720
So now we have access to this element and we can check the validation and valid and whatever.

77
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,470
OK we're going to do that right now.

78
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,830
So right from the start is whenever we check if it's valid or not if it's invalid We need to return

79
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,730
something.

80
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,470
So we're going to be returning if it's valid.

81
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,810
So this one is going to change.

82
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,430
True.

83
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,090
And if it's invalid of course it's going to be false.

84
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,470
And then if it's false you know it's not valid.

85
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,390
We need to return a message for this.

86
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,260
OK.

87
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,190
Whenever the applications start and we type something inside this and put this function is going to

88
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,430
run and right from the again this input is going to be valid.

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,870
So I'm going to return an array and you can see in a minute why it's going to be true.

90
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,290
And then the second session in the parade is going to be something empty.

91
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,750
So this one this position it's equal to the valet's message.

92
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,360
So we fight save this and run this right now this input it's going to be always true you know.

93
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,320
True because it's the ballot and then the message.

94
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,620
But then what are we going to do.

95
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,230
We're going to be doing some checking right here.

96
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,850
And at the end we can turn this error.

97
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,670
All right.

98
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,680
And this is going to be equal to this.

99
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,470
But if we do some checking right here and this element it's not valid.

100
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,440
We're going to return false and we're going to return the message.

101
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,900
So this data is going to receive an array with true or false.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,380
And the message or no message no.

103
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,570
That's the idea make sense.

104
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,490
So right here and going to start doing the check in and we do this with just simple gifts.

105
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,690
There's nothing magical right here.

106
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:42,570
So we need to access that element and Dot and I are going to be access validation the Dacian just like

107
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,040
that.

108
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,490
If I go to a user we are entering these key.

109
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,570
And now we're going to be checking if I have a required rule.

110
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,880
Are going to be creating the validation for required.

111
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,870
So if we do have an element that calls required and it's equal to true we want to run some code right

112
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,450
here.

113
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,820
So first I'm going to create a variable that is going to be called valid.

114
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,520
This one is going to be checking if the elements it's empty or not.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,780
So I'm going to say elements that are going to access the value dot.

116
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm going to trim it.

117
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,560
So if you have a white space it's going to remove that and begin to be checking if this elements it's

118
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,700
equal is not equal to an empty string.

119
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,380
So if you have an empty string there's one valid is going to be returning false.

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,270
Ok so I'm going to say Konst and message and it's going to be equal and I'm going to be returning some

121
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,070
template strings because of course we want to return a message.

122
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,370
We could do this differently.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,750
Just going to do it this way.

124
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,320
So I'm going to return some template strings.

125
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,670
So if they are valid it's not true.

126
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,750
No it's not valid.

127
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,940
We want to return a message but if it's not you want to return something empty.

128
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,570
So the message for a required is going to say this field is required.

129
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,090
Make sense.

130
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,670
Ok so I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to say error and it's going to be equal

131
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,120
to not valid.

132
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,660
I'm sorry if it's not valid.

133
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,500
The error is going to be equal to something or is going to be equal to no error which is the one we

134
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,840
have on top.

135
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,590
So OK let's go again if we can to check.

136
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,750
I'm in mistake right here.

137
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,570
Me.

138
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,470
There we go.

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,860
So we're going to be checking if this is valid.

140
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,410
This is going to be returning true or false.

141
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:44,750
If it's not valid begin at every turn this message inside the barbel message if it's valid begin out

142
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,770
not going to return anything.

143
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,540
Then this error of Will just the same we have on top it's going to be checking if it's valid.

144
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,820
So if it's not now that we want to return an array with the new values not with this once but if it's

145
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,840
valid we want to return error which is equal to true and nothing.

146
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,370
So OK so I'm going to go right here.

147
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,730
And first we return valid which is true or false.

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,910
In this case it's going to be of course false.

149
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,010
It's not valid.

150
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,460
And then we return an error message which is going to be message.

151
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,820
Let me make this better.

152
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,770
OK.

153
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,200
So now when I'm going to do.

154
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm going to do cancel long do right here and I'm going to be just doing a console log for the Bali

155
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,500
data.

156
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,890
All we have right here at the top are going to reload the application.

157
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:42,460
And of course I'm going to be going to type and Neph now since we have a N.F. it means that this input.

158
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,190
It's not empty.

159
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,140
So we have about you.

160
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,130
So this input is true and we have a message of none.

161
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,590
Nothing.

162
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,150
OK an empty message.

163
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,940
Now a five day lead.

164
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,250
If you're going to get false because it's not valid.

165
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,920
And you know we get this field is required.

166
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,670
OK.

167
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,660
So this valid data is getting an array with whatever we want to render.

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,650
You know we want to update the state of the form.

169
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,320
OK.

170
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,770
So we're going to be doing the same thing we did right here.

171
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,130
We're going to access the data we have right here and begin to change the values that we have inside

172
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,400
New state and I.D. and that it's going to be of course updating the state.

173
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,090
So OK.

174
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,740
So first we need to access the valid right here we have that valid.

175
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,440
We need to change it to true or false depending on what we have inside valid data.

176
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:42,020
So I'm going to say and use new state new and then state then I make a reference to the ID.

177
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,430
And then again I'm going to check I'm going to access the valid and now the information that we have

178
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,940
right here.

179
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,810
It's inside the array of valid data.

180
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:57,950
So I'm going to save valid data and it's going to be equal to the first position on the array.

181
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,380
So now I'm going to copy of this because we just need to change some things are going to be accessing

182
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:11,710
the news state ID and are going to be accessing the validation message and going to be changing that.

183
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,330
So hollidays message and I'm going to be passing whatever we have on the second position of the array

184
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,510
of ballot data.

185
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,750
So now I'm going to go right here I'm going to do a console log for the new state.

186
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:32,610
So if I do new state I'm going to get guns like a lock of the state to begin to be updating you know

187
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,550
this new state is going to go to change and change is going to be updating the whole state of the application.

188
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:49,640
So if I type in f I get name and name is going to be ballot true and validation message nothing.

189
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:58,670
Now if I go back it closes if I go back and deleted the next state of name is going to contain valid

190
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,250
falls.

191
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,540
So it's not valid.

192
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,380
And we have a message inside validation message.

193
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,420
This field is required.

194
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:05,940
OK.

195
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,790
So it's kind of working.

196
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,830
So now what we need to do we need a function that is going to be checking if we do have a message and

197
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,100
the input it's not valid and it's going to be showing a message right here because that's the main point

198
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,880
of this.

199
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,480
OK.

200
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,520
So I'm going to go back to form fields.

201
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm just going to just going to delete this for now.

202
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm going to save it.

203
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,640
Now where can we check if we have a message on the state.

204
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,570
We can do it on the template we can check on the template if we have a message down there and display

205
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,400
something or not.

206
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,590
So right here at the bottom I'm going to create a function that is going to say show validation we're

207
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:54,960
going to open and close and we need to pass whatever data we have inside each item inside the state

208
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,480
of each item.

209
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,700
In this case we have it inside values remember that we do data that settings.

210
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,920
So I'm going to be passing values.

211
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,380
We didn't have this function so far.

212
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,560
So going to be adding the function for now.

213
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,540
The function is going to be call Konst.

214
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:17,730
Again show validation and show validation is going to receive in arguments and then just you know just

215
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,670
render the information.

216
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,700
So the arguments I'm going to call data.

217
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,180
You can call it whatever you want.

218
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,030
You can pass values or you know it's up to you.

219
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:35,010
So right here what we do we are going to be returning a message an error message if we do have one inside

220
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,980
the state.

221
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,670
So I'm going to go right here and creative a marvel that is going to be called for and then message

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,100
makes sense right.

223
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,400
And it's going to be No.

224
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,730
For now it's going to be no.

225
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,350
So now what we need to we need to do we need to check if we have an error message an actual message.

226
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,770
So we are going to be checking data and then validation right.

227
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,340
Going to be checking if we have something inside validation if this one is true.

228
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,290
OK.

229
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,410
And then we're going to check something else we're going to check if the data is valid.

230
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,450
So if it's not valid it means that we have a message.

231
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,850
So we're going to be returning an error message.

232
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,530
We're going to say error message is it's going to be equal to return some GSX.

233
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:25,670
And then of course I'm going to be adding just one class name and I call that legal error.

234
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,030
It's going to be on the CSSA styles.

235
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:36,240
And inside here we need to add to pass whatever error message whatever message we're adding from the

236
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,860
validation right here.

237
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,250
And this one since we are getting right here the new state is going to be equal to this field required.

238
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:52,230
So if I open and close and say data dot and then validation message is going to be rendering whatever

239
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,140
message we have there.

240
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,800
And then at the end of course we need to return something.

241
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,750
So we return error.

242
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,130
And then message.

243
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,070
OK.

244
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,740
Look sermonize should be working.

245
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,570
So if I type f of course we didn't have an error message.

246
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:15,690
This is good but if I go back and deleted you know we are passing the information to the state.

247
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,590
The application read renderers.

248
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,250
And on this new render we do have an error message.

249
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:28,130
So it's going to detect it right here and it's going to be showing the validation message that we have

250
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,660
inside the new state.

251
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,050
So we get this field is required.

252
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,410
And if I type something this is State you know it's going to be valid.

253
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,910
So it's not going to be showing a message anymore and it's valid.

254
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,500
True.

255
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,290
So OK.

256
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,650
It works if I delete it.

257
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,520
We get the same result.

258
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,990
All right that's good.

259
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,970
So we're going to be adding more more things right here.

260
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,270
But you know again this video went too long.

261
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,040
Let's go to the to the next section.

262
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,680
You know the next video and going to be kind of finishing all of this.

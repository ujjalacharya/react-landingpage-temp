1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:08,550
OK so you might be thinking updating the redux state or making a network request should be real simple

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,290
but not really.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,810
There is a lot of logic and setting up we do.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,350
So we need to discuss now we do series and action creators just like we.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,240
We spoke in the previous on the previous lecture.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,180
So the action creator is going to be the one that is going to be called at first the action creator

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,860
will do something and then return an object with a type and a payload.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,540
This object is going to go to all the reducers and is going to search for the reduce or we manually

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,680
create for this action and that is going to be Abdy updating the redux state and once the estate gets

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,970
updated re-act is going to rerun under and display the information we need on the screen.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,580
So I know its really confusing.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,870
And again sorry but Im going to bring a chart to explain this a little bit better.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,960
And don't skip this chart.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,060
This one is really important.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,990
So let me bring the chart.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,390
OK so again our application someone is going to be entering our domain and our application should be

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,320
starting and home is going to be rendering a list of movies.

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,710
Right.

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,220
OK.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,030
So the first thing that is going to happen is that in our code we said that we want a list of movies

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,500
or a lot of movies.

22
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,340
So first what's going to happen.

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,340
Are we going to be using in-action creator Now this action creator is going to go of course to the to

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,340
the actual server is going to bring the data we need.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,400
And at the end when this action creator it's done is going to be returning an object.

26
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:50,130
So what is going to be returning is this object we have on screen now this object contains a type and

27
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,110
a payload the type.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,070
If you noticed it's just the keyboard.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,000
So the type could be ID.

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,470
Right.

31
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,140
So it's just an ID.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,210
And then the payload contains the information we fetched from the server.

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,880
You know the list of movies.

34
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,650
So again but it's just an object with a type and a payload to ride with it.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,380
When an ID and a list of movies but of course we call it type and payload inside the redux world.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,380
So OK so this action creator is going to be returning this object so the action creator will return

37
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,410
an object of course with the action and the action type and the pillow.

38
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,520
So whenever we have this done redux it's going to be sending this to all the reducers.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,820
Now the main job of the reducers is going to be receiving this object with the type in a payload.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,150
So it's going to match the type is going to look at the type.

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,060
In this case it's going to be movie and it's going to be searching to all the reducers with it to find

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,280
a reducer that it's assigned for this job.

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,160
OK so we have a reducers a search for the movie.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,660
All right.

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,900
So it's going to take a look at the object take a look at the time.

46
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,400
It's going to see a movie and say OK I need to find the reducer with the type of movie is going to search

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,470
all is going to find one and after finds the the correct we desire the reducer is going to be updating

48
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,260
the redux state is going to grab whatever we have inside the payload which is the list of movies and

49
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,740
then it's going to be passing this to the to the state and we can restore everything of course.

50
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,690
And now since it's updating the redux state the redux state is going to be telling the application that

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,300
we have the movies the list of movies ready.

52
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,600
So now you should be rendering the actual queen.

53
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,050
You know the actual you know this is what happens with between action creators and we do.

54
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,430
That's why they are so important.

55
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,010
Without them redux is not going to work.

56
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,760
So now we need to learn how to create action creators and how to create reducers.

57
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,610
So let's do that right now.

58
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,680
OK so now what we need to do we need to create.

59
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,540
We do so we're going to be doing that make sense.

60
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,270
You know maybe you're thinking oh are we going to do an action creator because is the first step on

61
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,780
the list.

62
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,730
Well now we're going to be starting with reducers.

63
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,480
It's easier that way.

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,660
So this provider it's using redux is creating a store and this creates store uses this middleware.

65
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,790
Now this creates store with middleware.

66
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,380
It's going to be using.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,370
It's going to be a list of all the reducers we have inside inside our application.

68
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,730
And you might be thinking OK just greeting reducers in obtaining the state it might it should be real

69
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,440
simple right.

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,500
Well not really.

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,060
If there is a lot of things we need to do just to get this starting now just to get this started.

72
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,600
So the reason why we Duc's is so popular it's because when you learn to do all this process it's always

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,340
the same goes to the action goes to the reduce or update the state and that's done.

74
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:03,020
So in a large scale application where you make a lot of network requests and updates read it's going

75
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,030
to make it really simple.

76
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,840
That's why I saw part so popular.

77
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,740
You repeat the same process and it works really good.

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,660
So first before we can do anything this store and create install with middleware is going to need a

79
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,870
list of all the reducers inside our application.

80
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,410
So what we do as a convention we create a new directory in your folder inside source that in this case

81
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,720
is going to be called reducers.

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,970
So we do Sir's is going to have one file in this case that is going to be called index that jazz This

83
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,960
file is really important.

84
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,330
And then what we get inside this folder is going to be files for you know whenever we do what you need

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,730
in this case we are going to be receiving movies.

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,090
So I'm going to be calling this movie reducers Danja at reducers singler.

87
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,120
So again right here we're going to be receiving whatever reduced we get.

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,790
We're going to be putting whatever we desire we need for movies.

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,830
You could have a lot of reducers you could have used a reducers.

90
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,620
I don't know actors directors or reduce or doesn't matter.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,290
You could have a lot.

92
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:18,620
Now the thing is when we go back to index digest this create story with men where it's going to be receiving

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,500
the reducers and it's going to need a list of all the reducers since we could have a lot of reducers.

94
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,020
We need a way to combine all the reducers we have inside our application into one.

95
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,450
So we need to combine all the reducers.

96
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,750
So that's why we are using this index.

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,730
Non-jazz next and next is going to be combining all the reducers and then pass it to the create store

98
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,720
with men where it's going to go to digest.

99
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:54,050
And since we need to combine reducers are going to be importing something that calls combine and then

100
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,960
reducers just like this.

101
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,670
Let me make it right.

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,890
Combined we juicers.

103
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,690
And this one comes from redux because now we are working with redux not with the re-act weeks.

104
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,600
So we're going to say redux.

105
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,440
OK.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,920
So this combined with Dysart's is going to be passing something that calls core root.

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,630
We do serve.

108
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,230
And again it's a convention.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,190
It's going to be equal to and we're going to be using this combined reducers.

110
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:29,030
So this combined reducers is going to be receiving a list of all the reducers in this case we have a

111
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,670
redo for movies so we can say movies right.

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,140
So this is a viable This concept is going to it's going to go to index.

113
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,520
And this is going to be using this and this would reduce our contains a list of all the reducers since

114
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,690
we need to make this Marvel available for other components.

115
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,530
We're going to do export than default.

116
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,650
And then of course we do sir.

117
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,470
OK.

118
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,500
So this is done.

119
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,870
This is the only thing we need to do right here hear you have more reducers you just add them right

120
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,320
here.

121
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,900
Actors you know directors whatever.

122
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,930
Ok since now we just get one just movies.

123
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:18,610
I'm going to go back to yes and these create store with middleware is going to need that list of producers.

124
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,870
So going to go right here at the top I'm going to say in port reducers from.

125
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,990
And it's going to be dot for Slash and then reducers.

126
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,800
There's no need for us to do index because you know it is an index.

127
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,480
It already knows.

128
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,060
Since we have the reducers sorry.

129
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,650
What are we going to do.

130
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,630
We can grab this reducers and we're going to be passing this to the store and the create store with

131
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,110
middleware.

132
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,400
So we pass the reducers good makes sense.

133
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,220
I hope so.

134
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,140
OK.

135
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,820
So okay everything looks there.

136
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,380
The only thing is that right here we are not including anything we are saying that you know we have

137
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,120
or we do series that cause movies.

138
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,070
But you know there's nothing inside and we are not importing anything to movies.

139
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,260
It's not that fine.

140
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:11,800
I'm going to go right here at the top and I'm going to say import movies from Dad forward slash and

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,700
then movies we.

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,980
So now of course it's going to be receiving a valid valid component.

143
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,200
Now at least we're getting halo.

144
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,740
OK.

145
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,760
It's the least rendering something.

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,060
But of course we have an error message stored does not have a ballot reducer.

147
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Make sure the arguments pass and you know whatever it is you know it's right because inside movies reducer

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,210
we don't have a ballot reduced or we don't have anything to add.

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,560
We do so right now.

150
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,540
So let's do this right now.

151
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,200
OK so let's create a valid reducers.

152
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,220
So a few things are going to happen.

153
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,960
First I'm going to you know I'm going to pass this right here.

154
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,940
So the first thing that's going to happen and action is going to be returning an object.

155
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,150
So whenever the action returns an object is going to be entering here.

156
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,790
The second thing that is going to be happening is that instead of here a reducer is going to be trying

157
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:14,060
to find a match with whatever we pass we have inside the type of the action are going to get to paste

158
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,760
something something like this and paste it down here.

159
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,520
So whenever we have this action triggers and returns an object is going to be just looking like to look

160
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,280
something like this.

161
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,970
This action is going to be equal to an object and this onda object is going to contain that type and

162
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,740
a payload.

163
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,510
So now this file contains contains an action with a type and a payload.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,440
So now what we can do we can go right here and try to find a match.

165
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,530
So this reducer of course this is not real.

166
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,780
OK we are going to be splitting this in a minute.

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,860
So this reduced or what it's going to be.

168
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,620
It's going to be it's going to be just a function and this function is going to have a switch inside

169
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,740
so we can find a match.

170
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,140
Right.

171
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,750
OK.

172
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,800
So I'm going to say oh sorry going to delete this.

173
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,890
And first I'm going to say export the default and what we export is going to be just to function right.

174
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,580
OK.

175
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:15,700
So this function needs to have to do just two arguments and they are really important arguments and

176
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,660
arguments is going to be the previous state.

177
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,220
And then the action.

178
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,750
And this is equal equal to whatever we are receiving right here.

179
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,320
You know this action with the type and a payload.

180
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,870
So this state is going to be the previous state.

181
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,160
Let me mix in space right here.

182
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,830
So let's pretend the the state know whenever the application starts.

183
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,040
Of course the state is going to be empty or you know you can have just a default state.

184
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,630
So you know the application start starts and we have a state of zero.

185
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,690
So then you're going to be receiving an action which is an object and we're going to be searching right

186
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,960
here with a switch for that action and then that type.

187
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,280
So whenever we find a match what we want to do.

188
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,900
The main purpose of doing all of this is going to be updating the state so the state is going to be

189
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,890
equal to zero.

190
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,160
You know right now it's equal to zero.

191
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,350
So we enter here we find a match.

192
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,590
And what are we going to be doing.

193
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,640
We're going to be returning the state which equals to zero.

194
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,630
But since now we have information we're going to be changing the state.

195
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,120
So it's kind of a look doing like this begin going to grab the previous state which is zero and we're

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,170
going to be adding one.

197
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,890
OK.

198
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,680
So maybe later on the application later the user is going to enter to a section where we need to fetch.

199
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,460
We need to trigger this action again.

200
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,830
So we're going to be fetching the list of movies again.

201
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,620
So again we're going to do the same process is going to return an object with whatever data is going

202
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,310
to be entering this function.

203
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,320
And now the state equals do one right.

204
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Not zero.

205
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,290
So when we find a match we return this state which is one and then plus one.

206
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,310
So now the state equals two.

207
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,130
That is why we have the previous state right here.

208
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,310
So we can add to the previous state the new state.

209
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,020
You know we can modify the state and then returned the actual state of course this is not real.

210
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,970
We can do something else.

211
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,820
Now if you think about it right here the state is just the system Arbel.

212
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,410
We don't have anything just yet.

213
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,060
But whenever we see it whenever the application starts this state is going to be just an object so what

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,880
we do.

215
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,520
We set it as a default object.

216
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,940
So whenever it starts it's an empty object.

217
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,330
Of course we're going to be doing something right here and we're going to be changing this.

218
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,670
So again the main purpose of this function is to receive an action match a type and then change to take

219
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,040
it.

220
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,540
Right.

221
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,170
OK.

222
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,810
So now what do we do.

223
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,600
What are we going to be entering break here and what we do is just a switch just like we did with the

224
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,570
with templates inside react same idea.

225
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,680
We do a switch.

226
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:03,510
We match a template and we do something in this case the switch is going to be always listening for

227
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,430
this object.

228
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,020
Right.

229
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:09,470
And inside of this object we're going to be trying to find a match for that type.

230
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,340
And again this is just an idea a keyboard.

231
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,140
So again since we want to match the type we say action that type you know it's an object we can enter

232
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,540
to the action just like that.

233
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,630
So now this type is going to be equal to something right.

234
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,340
OK.

235
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:32,070
Now in the case and right here we need to do it manually of course if the case is that we see an object

236
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,170
with the type of movie at least we want to do something right here.

237
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,920
Just do something.

238
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,630
Now we have a default case so we need to do default and what we do we return the previous To say you

239
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,420
know we are not changing the state so we return state.

240
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,400
OK so nothing is going to get changed.

241
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,880
Now if the case is that we find a match you know we have a type of movies list we want to do something.

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,780
So what we do we return something and what are we going to be returning is going to be again just an

243
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,750
object to replace the state.

244
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:16,560
Now remember we have the previous state so we kind of need to include the previous state inside of this

245
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,930
one just not to mutate information you know just not to mutate an object.

246
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,270
So what we do we say that this thing that we're going to be returning this object is going to be equal

247
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,320
to dot dot dot state.

248
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,980
So this object is going to contain all the previous information right.

249
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,010
So it's like having an app application where you have a state or something like this that is going to

250
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,840
be equal to an object and maybe right here you have name.

251
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:51,130
Maybe you have no one ever parents and this one is going to be an RE whenever.

252
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:51,830
Right.

253
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,810
So whenever we entered this scenario the state it's equal to this.

254
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:03,040
If we find a match of movies well remember that inside the payload we have the data we need.

255
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:10,500
So what we do we pass this object with the previous state that contains name imperent and then we added

256
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,280
something we added whatever we are getting from the payload.

257
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:22,770
So we say now that that movie is going to be called to action DOD payload something like that.

258
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:30,360
So now this is going to be returning a new state and now the state is going to be equal to movies just

259
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,750
like this with you know the list of movies or whatever.

260
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,060
So let me delete all this.

261
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,300
You're not going to need it.

262
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,050
We just need this.

263
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:46,180
So if I save it we're going to go right here and we are not getting an error message.

264
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,280
So that is good.

265
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,530
This is a valid reducer.

266
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,010
Again just it's just a function with a previous state and an action.

267
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:02,010
And whenever we find a match for the keyboard inside the action we returned the previous state and whatever

268
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,910
data we get from the action that payload that is the main purpose of having this reduced.

269
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,970
This is the only thing that we can do.

270
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:17,680
And this is going to be updating the state inside redux OK that's good that's enough for now.

271
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:24,290
So now what we need to do we need to create a Nachum creator that you know does this that that connects

272
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,240
to this every douceur and passes all the information we need to do that.

273
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,170
So let's go to the next section and add an action creator.

1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,390
So we react we can output inline dynamic content.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,370
I know this sounds a little bit confusing but let me show you with some code.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,380
It's real simple.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,750
Let's say that instead of returning this is my new header I want to show the dates.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,090
So I'm going to say the date is now right here.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,030
I need to pass some dynamic content.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,830
I'm going to get the date in milliseconds from javascript so I'm going to use curly braces and inside

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,570
the curly braces we can put some logic right here.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,090
So I'm going to use vanilla Yes if sex is fine.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,670
Sorry my little javascript I'm going to say now this is going to return to date in milliseconds.

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,590
So you finally reloaded and check it.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,680
The date is in milliseconds.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,460
So inside curly braces we can do pretty much whatever we want as long as we return a single statement

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,420
a single expression.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,900
So let's say I want to print the ear.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,630
So I'm going to just say this I'm going to make it just like this.

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,730
So it's a little bit more readable but it's the same idea.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,130
So to return the date for the year first I need to create a variable that is going to be called new

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,520
date and this one is going to create an instance of date just like this date.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,330
And then if you wanted to get the ear from from there you need to return the new date just like this

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,870
and Dot and get full year.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,020
So this is again it's another Javascript.

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,690
So this is one is not going to work is going to give as an error message because you're using two different

24
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,530
expressions.

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,910
First we have the verbal and then we are doing the return.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,940
So this one is not going to work.

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,550
But what we can do to solve this.

28
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,900
We can create a function that returns that data.

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,890
So I'm going to go over here and again to say Konst get your.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,860
Something like that.

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,910
And then it's going to be just a fat Aro function and this fat function is going to do this logic and

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,900
it cut and paste that and we get your and this function only returns that year.

33
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:13,690
So now if I say get your just like this and I call to this function is going to give us back the ear.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,640
So it's going to work.

35
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,810
So this is good.

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,000
And you can do it right here pretty much whatever you want as long as you return a single expression.

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,770
So we can do operations kind of a five plus five.

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,020
That's going to work.

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,690
We get the data Stan you know it's good we're here to get ears inside but never used.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm going to delete it just for now.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,000
So why is this important.

42
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:45,290
Let's pretend that instead of Hetter we have kind of a user profile so we need we have an object of

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,650
the user with all the data inside and what we want to do we want to render the user data.

44
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,570
So I'm going to say Konst then user is going to be called to an object and it's going to have a name

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:03,290
and the name is going to be Frances of course if you if you're it's it's the first time for you in one

46
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,190
of my courses.

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,200
This is my main default user name it's Francis.

48
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,170
And the last name.

49
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,360
You guessed it Jones.

50
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,760
And let's say an age of 16.

51
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,060
So this is really important.

52
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,350
We just have an object.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,190
So now if you want to output a card the card to every user are going to just put it just like this and

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,790
enclose everything remember everything in Princie just like that.

55
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,430
And now this one this dev is going to be the main container we need to.

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,820
We can only output some GSX inside a container.

57
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,590
And right here I can just put Dev and make a reference to that object.

58
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,020
It's going to be user name.

59
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,850
And if I wanted to get the last name.

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,510
Same thing.

61
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,130
User Data last name.

62
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,890
So this is going to be the way.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,620
How how can we the way we output output dynamic data inside react and age.

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,110
And if we go right here we get Frances Jones and 16.

65
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,470
So you know this is really really simple but we're going to be using that.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,990
Using this the whole the whole time.

67
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:19,430
So let's pretend let's just pretend that this user is going to be validating if the user is able to

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,860
access right here.

69
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:29,390
So again we can just run a function check if the user it's authorized to enter our our page or web page

70
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,350
our application.

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,240
And right here we get it just past True or false.

72
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,290
And this one is going to love the content that the page load are not going to do that later of course.

73
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,180
So OK let's keep moving forward.

74
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,330
We're going to be talking about types of components.

75
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,420
It's going to be really interesting.

76
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,040
So let's go to the next one.

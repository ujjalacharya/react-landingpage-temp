1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,950
OK so we are going to talk a little bit more about stylings and if you're going to use styles as an

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,420
import just like the head or digests or with a link inside the HD L that is cool.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,780
That's good anyways.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,180
But sometimes we can use the SS and we need to fall back to some javascript logic.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,840
So I'm going to show you some different ways and this is not react this is just javascript logic programming

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,210
Gloc logic.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,510
So OK so what I want to do I went to add a background to the header right here.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,040
I went to change it to no read.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,460
I going to say Konst style.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,410
And then I just create an object with the style of the background.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,000
It's going to say background and then this one is going to be equal to red.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:53,590
So now we want to pass the style we say style equal to style just like that.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,250
So that's good.

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,140
You know it's working.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,970
We know this.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,750
Well what happens if what I want to do I went to check if the keywords are empty.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,010
If this impot it's empty and leave it at one color.

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,850
But as soon as I start typing something I went to change the color to something else.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,320
So then we need to go and fall back to some javascript logic we could say if the keywords are empty

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,680
remember that the keywords we have them on state when whenever we change them so we could change the

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,570
state of that.

22
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,590
And if they are empty We're going to do something.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,750
If not begin to do something else.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,470
So I could do something like this.

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,180
State that keywords.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,070
It's different than this than empty.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,060
And we're going to say style that my background just like that it's going to be called to do.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,670
OK.

29
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,440
Let me match it and then if not we're going to do else we're going to do the opposite of this.

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,160
So I'm going to say read whenever there's a matter.

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,720
So if I type something is going to change to blue if I go back to empty it stays as read.

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,420
So we could use some logic like this using the state of physics.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,120
OK so we're OK we can do something else.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,090
Let's do something different.

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to just comment this for now just for now and what I want to do I want to say that the style

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,360
of the header is going to be read.

37
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,810
So right here inside styles what we can do we can pass styles directly.

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,970
And what we can we need to do we need to use double curly braces.

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,400
So now right here what I could do I could say background and it's equal to read something like that.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,820
And of course we can get the background read.

41
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,840
So most of the time you're going to be using this whenever you have some dynamic data and you need to

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,840
put the background image and then you are l where you can do something like this.

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:55,820
Now again if I type something this is not dynamic so I need to change this this value dynamically.

44
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,330
So how can you do that.

45
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,430
Well we can use the state for example.

46
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm going to go to state again to say active and whenever the application starts this active it's going

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,010
to be false.

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,830
So now what I can do right here I can check if the state that active it's true and show red and if it's

49
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,790
false show Blue they're going to delete this and they're going to be using template strings.

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,050
Simple strings are really really cool.

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,970
We can do operations inside.

52
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,090
So I'm going to do door sign open in close curly braces.

53
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,770
So now read here what we can do.

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,080
We can do some ternary operation.

55
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,710
Does that state that active stuff like that.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,420
And if it's false We're going to set it to read and if it's not begin to set it to do

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,260
something like that.

58
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,760
OK.

59
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,820
So let's see if it's working.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,820
I'm going to do this and type something and delete and nothing happens.

61
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,970
And this is because we are not changing the state of active.

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,990
Remember that we are doing it right here.

63
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,780
So to do this we'll have to go to the input change handler and create a viable that is going to be checking

64
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,840
if it's empty or not and said the new state.

65
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,290
So I'm going to say Konst style makes sense.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,850
Now let's change it to value something different.

67
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,120
So we're going to catch that event or target that value and begin to check if it's empty or not.

68
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,820
So if it's 3PL equal to empty We're going to say that the state is going to be false.

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,010
If not it's going to be true.

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,440
So now we have the True or False inside of a marvel.

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,080
Whenever we type something and we pass the event to change handler.

72
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,620
So now we need to change the state of active to whatever value we are getting out of this.

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,880
And they're going to do coma.

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,920
And of course the state is going to change if I type something it's changed.

75
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,230
And if it's not if it's empty we go back to blue.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,730
So you can use some logic like this using the state and changing state.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,580
OK.

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,350
So let me let me give you one more one more.

79
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:13,350
Let's say that instead of just passing the inline styling just like this what I want to do I want to

80
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,530
change.

81
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,480
You know just a class.

82
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,070
OK.

83
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,130
So I'm going to delete all of this.

84
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm sorry for the deleting and not deleting so I could say this that state that active.

85
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,560
So this in fact is going to be a class and not some styles.

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,900
So I'm going to go to active right here at the bottom of the top sorry and I can say that this act if

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,640
it is is going to be equal to active just like that active the default state it's going to be active.

88
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,390
So now right here instead of changing to true from true or false.

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,600
What we can do we can swap classes.

90
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:57,480
We can say that the new state of active is going to be active or non active is going to say active and

91
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:06,100
then we change it to non active makes sense not to.

92
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:06,960
OK.

93
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,520
So now it's going to reload up.

94
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,810
We get the message.

95
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,880
I a mistake right here.

96
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,270
The bottom.

97
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,700
What am I doing this state active.

98
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,030
Of course it's not a style it is going to be the class name for that.

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,360
OK.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,300
So everything works if you type something.

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,750
Of course it's not working.

102
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:33,000
But if I changed if I check the console let me check the class name of this for now whenever we start

103
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,890
is going to be active.

104
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,950
But if I type something is going to change to not active.

105
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,150
And if I go back to zero we get back active.

106
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,030
So we're going to be swapping classes right here and we can do the same thing.

107
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,890
We can add the CSA as we can add that active and not active class to this time elsea says.

108
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,540
And it's going to work its a different way of doing things.

109
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,290
You know you have three different methods to do this.

110
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:04,680
Of course we have a lot more methods and that's the main point of this section and the next in the next

111
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,410
century in the next section so we can change all of this just like this.

112
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:17,440
Again it's up to you but we have tons of libraries for stylings and they are really really cool.

113
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,330
So let's check them out.

114
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,140
OK so I'm going to show you how to use applying for this.

115
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,880
We have tons of plug ins to work with CSX.

116
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,230
So yes that's the first I'm going to delete all of this because we're not going to need it at all.

117
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,030
Let me just delete this.

118
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,090
Just go back to lead.

119
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,550
Or I was done and to this state.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,820
So now I'm going to go to the useless item and begin to test this library from you list item.

121
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,530
So I get to go right here and I'm going to say react and the library is going to call glam or not when

122
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,290
you just glam or something like that.

123
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,510
And we're going to get it right here 3.1 clamor.

124
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,660
So with this with this dependency with this module what we can do we can use CSSA inline Lycia says

125
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,700
just like this.

126
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,440
And then clamors is going to work it's going to do its job and we can pass the rules we can pass holders

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,120
we can we can use we can even use media equerries.

128
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,230
And then it's going to pass that as a rule or as a class name or whatever.

129
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,860
It's really cool.

130
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,420
So let's install this first and we're going to show you how it's going to work on the kill the server

131
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:33,370
of course and we need to do NPM install and then it's going to be called glam or Glam or so just like

132
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:33,790
that.

133
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,550
And then minus minus safe.

134
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,280
So this one is a little bit slow.

135
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,690
It's going to take a little while to install it.

136
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,710
When was done OK it's done.

137
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,220
So I'm going to do clear and I'm going to do NPM start again.

138
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,210
So no to use it.

139
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,570
First we need to require the library.

140
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,310
So I'm going to go back to the project and in say in say import any curly braces.

141
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,370
Say yes yes.

142
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,650
So this is actually the instructions from glummer I'm not making this up right here.

143
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,360
So it is going to be CSSA.

144
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,750
And then from.

145
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,300
And then glam or.

146
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:22,250
So now what we need to do we need to create a rule to pass it right here to this news item.

147
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,640
This one right here.

148
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,350
So I'm going to go before the return and get a career viable that is going to be called news underscore

149
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,480
item something real simple.

150
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,280
First we need to invoke the method that we are requiring on top and this method is going to take an

151
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,800
object right here.

152
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,980
We can pass whatever class we want.

153
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,760
So what I want to do going to make this a little bit better just a little bit better.

154
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,720
I to add padding and the padding is going to be pixel's something like that.

155
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,160
Of course it's an object so we need to do coma that we need to use box sizing.

156
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,560
So I sing good.

157
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:07,860
And the sizing is going to be border you know the box in a coma and I'm going to add a board there and

158
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:15,210
then bottom of one pixel pixels solid gray that makes sense.

159
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,320
So now we have this now.

160
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,200
We are not getting any errors you know.

161
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,150
Looks good.

162
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,360
It says that we have this Vrable and it's not being used.

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
We're going to use it in a minute.

164
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,240
So now to pass to you to use this class because we're pretty much creating the class what we can do.

165
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,680
We go to the actual elements where we need that class and we can say in curly braces that oh sorry dot

166
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,510
dot dot.

167
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,650
And then the name of the class which is going to be news item.

168
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,490
So I'm going to do that and if a reload.

169
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,400
You know we get it it's working it seems like a mistake right here.

170
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,080
The bottom should be working now.

171
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,770
There you go.

172
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,300
You know it works really really really cool.

173
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,190
So OK what happens if I want to add two different styles to different classes right here.

174
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,850
Well again we could create a new variable that is going to be item and grey or something like that.

175
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,200
And then of course we need to use the CSSA open the method and pass an object.

176
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:24,050
And I could say background something like that of gray lets use light gray.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,430
I believe it's like a light gray Burguet.

178
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:39,210
So now if I went to pass a second class what we can do is the same process dot dot and then am gray.

179
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,830
And we get it it's using both classes this dot dot dot that we're using right here.

180
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,850
It's ESX.

181
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,290
It's not you know from the from Glenmore it's.

182
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,920
It's saying grab all the properties that we have inside that element and put them inside of here.

183
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,490
That's what pretty much it's doing.

184
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,860
So we can use a we can use more things.

185
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,160
What happens if I went to add a homer you know just a Hoover right here on each element.

186
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,890
Well I'm going to do comb I'm going to go below here.

187
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,390
And what we say is corn and then Hoover just like that.

188
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,740
And then of course this is going to be something else.

189
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,080
And then color.

190
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,270
And we're going to change it to read make sense.

191
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,950
Good.

192
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,400
So whenever we do however we are going to change it to red.

193
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,460
And you know it's working.

194
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,460
It's really really nice.

195
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,020
So what else we can do we have a few more things and what happens if we want to check.

196
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,940
We went to work with media queries again just like the Hoeber right here.

197
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,390
We can add a media query for this element.

198
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,160
So we are going to say and then media.

199
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:50,150
Then of course we need to open it close and I'm going to say Max what you can do with it's up to you.

200
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,220
This is just yes and they're going to save 500 pixels whatever.

201
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,430
And then of course we say calm and we pass the tiles.

202
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:05,960
And this chair in this case I can change the whole color to blue whatever but it's going to reload the

203
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,210
page of course going to make it.

204
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,050
And there we go.

205
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,950
You know it's catching that media Querrey.

206
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,090
So OK we can do a lot of thanks.

207
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,150
You can check the condition.

208
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,150
We have it all right here we have the docs.

209
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,510
It has some demos.

210
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,640
So you can you can check this out.

211
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,080
But don't do it just now.

212
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,190
We're going to be doing some all this stuff.

213
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,530
Let's say that for example right here we are creating an instance.

214
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,320
So this is going to be kind of a kind of a class name and right here we're kind of injecting a data

215
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,010
attribute.

216
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,520
Let me just do an inspection and show you.

217
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's go and make it bigger.

218
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,710
It's going to go to elements and select each elements.

219
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,140
So you know right here we didn't have the class in the name of this.

220
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:58,540
We have a data attribute and if we go to Hetter we can see that it's a pending Goldstein's right here.

221
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,710
But this is a data attribute.

222
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,760
So again this library is going to give us the ability to use classes.

223
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,210
They're going to read all of this and I can add a class name.

224
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,100
So instead of a data attribute what we can do we can pass a template strings with the value of whatever

225
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,250
class you're creating right here at the top.

226
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,840
So I'm going to say this.

227
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,630
And then of course I'm going to be adding the item gray.

228
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,380
So we do the same dollar sign open close and then I'd say this is template strings.

229
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:35,850
OK guys if you are you're getting confused with this because you need to learn a little bit more about

230
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,480
ESX.

231
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:43,910
Remember that the last module of this discourse is going to be a whole course with ESX.

232
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,480
OK you know we are still getting it and now we are getting a class of this.

233
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,400
And if you check the head right here we are getting you know the classes.

234
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,860
So you know this works right.

235
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,390
So what else.

236
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,760
You know what you can do.

237
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,960
You can use this approach if you like this one you can use it.

238
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,520
It's not bad.

239
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,570
You know this methods are not bad.

240
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,000
They work really good.

241
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,090
So we are going to be talking about something else we're going to be going to the next action because

242
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,090
this video went too long and we'll be talking about S as modules.

243
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,860
That's kind of a new concept.

244
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,440
Can you show you how to how to use it.

245
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,890
It's going to get a little bit confusing but don't worry we're going to begin to do it right.

246
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,240
Practically do it on the project and begin going to be using that one.

247
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,620
OK.

248
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,260
So let's go to the next section.

1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:01,680
All right.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,000
So this section is going to be pretty much about the sixth constructor and classes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,630
That's not strictly related to react.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,600
It's not from re-act it's directly from ESX.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,630
Now if you know E6 classes like the palm of your hand you just can move forward no problem.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,750
So I've created a new file is going to be called Playground digests an included data file inside index

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,870
that you mail.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,170
So I'm going to start doing the things I'm going to say class and I'm going to click create a class

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,110
of for car.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,290
At first you're not going to get it.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,870
But you know just keep moving forward.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,120
You're going to get it at the end.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,200
Don't worry.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,870
So right here I get to say I'm going to create a method for this.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,980
Is going to say Alert brand whatever.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,460
And this brand is going to just be a function that it's going to be doing a lock for hay.

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,620
So now we have a class with a meth inside now what I want to do I need to create an instance of this

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,880
car so I can use the method alert brand.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,790
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to say car is going to be equal to new and then car.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,850
This is just like constructor functions in iOS 5.

21
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,760
So if I want to output to trigger that function I'm going to say Alert brand.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,190
And if we go to the browser we get hey.

23
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,040
Good.

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,630
So let me change it to Ford so he can make us make a little bit more sense for it.

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,530
Very good.

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:37,020
So now what happens if I need a new class and I want to inherit some of the properties we have right

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,800
here.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,430
OK.

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,240
So I'm going to add that the large brand and now with constructor's constructor function we can add

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,950
methods inside of the prototype of this constructor function.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,000
You know that's classic is fine.

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,660
So with ESX going to do the things a little bit different.

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,820
So we can just say constructor and inside the constructor we can have all the properties of this car

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,530
are going to say this because this means the car of course and then wheels something like that and it's

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,540
going to be equal to four.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:20,890
And then we're going to have this dot and then type and this type is going to be a hatchback.

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,760
Never had a hatchback.

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,020
It's going to do she but you know you can like them good.

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,750
So now this car has a constructor inside of the prototype of this class.

40
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,640
You can have this virga.

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:39,000
So now what I want to do I went to create a new class and inherit this options.

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,470
So I'm going to go to class and I get to create a class A it.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,050
I'm going to open and close.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,670
Now how can I inherited this inside here.

45
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,580
So we're going to be using the keyword extends just like we did with the constructor with the components.

46
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,100
Well same idea.

47
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,290
I'm going to say extents and then space and then car just like that car.

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:13,480
So now these properties are inside and available of Ford we are inheriting the car inside Ford.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,690
So if I create a new instance of Ford it's going to be equal to new forward.

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,880
Of course you know Ford and then I do cons. look for the wheels that we don't have right here.

51
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,950
But since we are inheriting the car we have access to the wheels.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,270
I'm going to say cancel that law and then say Ford Dadds wheels.

53
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,070
And if we go we get four.

54
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,330
OK let's get.

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:46,020
So with extents we are inheriting whatever it's inside the construction of a different class.

56
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,730
OK.

57
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,240
That's good.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,890
Now what happens if I need to add a constructor inside car.

59
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,180
I'm going to say constructor opening close.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,850
And for now I'm going to say this that I don't know Windows something like that and it's going to be

61
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,080
equal to four.

62
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,380
And right here.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,110
Notice that I'm doing Ford wheels and if I go right here to the browser you're getting must call super

64
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,400
constructor endured class.

65
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,490
OK so what is the problem.

66
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:24,570
We are adding a constructor right here and we're still inheriting all the constants of car.

67
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,180
So the thing is that you're creating a constructor function that it's empty.

68
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,610
So we need a way to instruct the constructor that we did it extents and we want to add whatever options

69
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,820
we have on car and we need to add it to the disk constructor.

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,250
So what we do is we use the keyword super.

71
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,730
So I'm going to say super and just super and then Super just like this.

72
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,560
Oh sorry I'm gonna look at this for now.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,610
So we are calling super and then super is going to bring whatever we are bringing from extents and put

74
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,280
it inside of the are over for it.

75
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,470
So if I go right here we get four.

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,840
So that's the main purpose of super.

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,650
You're bringing whatever you are extending and putting it inside the constructor of this class.

78
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,250
Good.

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,770
OK.

80
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:22,400
You know a lot of logic and you're probably saying Dude what this has to do with re-act this 06 got

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,390
nothing to do with that.

82
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,150
Well on the next lecture we're going to be talking about state and a few more things and we're not going

83
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,730
to directly use it but you're going to see it on a lot of places.

84
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:41,530
So remember that when it where when whenever we were on Hetter we create a class that extends component.

85
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,330
So this component comes from a react and react class.

86
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:53,900
So right here whenever we create a class for our our project we are extending a lot of properties and

87
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,570
method that the the date re-act class has.

88
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:04,070
So something like when we go right here this one is going to be called react just like that.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,860
And then inside the constructor we have something that is called props some like that and props is going

90
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,820
to be an object with a lot of things inside.

91
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,940
Whatever MiddleEast this.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,020
So then we begin to create a new begin to create a new class of something for example a new page and

93
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,130
this new page is going to be extending react.

94
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,770
So whenever we call the constructor we get all the properties and method from the parent class which

95
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,600
is react and of course we can do a lot of things just like we are doing right here.

96
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,320
That's the main purpose of the class.

97
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,650
Now classes are really important and but but they're kind of heavy.

98
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,070
So we always need to try to avoid classes.

99
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:53,210
We will talk about this in the next few lectures for now as soon as you get what we are doing with the

100
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,020
constructor and probs and everything else.

101
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:56,960
That's good.

102
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,980
A little bit more about classes.

103
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,170
You know we now know a little bit more about classes.

104
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,590
OK that's good.

105
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,080
Let's go to the next section and we're going to be talking about state and state.

106
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,040
It's really really important for us.

107
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,730
So let's keep move forward.

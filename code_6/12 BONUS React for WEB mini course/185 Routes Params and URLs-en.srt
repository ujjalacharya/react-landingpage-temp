1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,320
Right.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,160
So what happens if I'm inside posts and right here inside post.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,790
I'm going to get just a list of posts.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,270
Let's pretend that we want to build it.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,250
Why not.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,610
So I'm going to have the post number one.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,280
You're going to have the opposed number two for example and then maybe post number three.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,280
Just three simple posts.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,140
So whenever we load the supplication I'm going to have this list I'm going to bring the link Madill

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,580
right here just like we are doing it right here.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,790
Just get a copy of this go to posts and paste it down here.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,890
I'm going somewhere.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,620
Don't worry.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,240
And then what we need to do we need to link to this specific post.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,440
So this post list is going to come from a database lets say whatever database.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,890
And this of course is going to do the linkage to the actual post.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,690
So are we going to use a link We're going to rappel ink just right here.

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,900
We're going to say Lenk and then just you know link link.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,930
Let me finish.

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,220
But this of course is going to be it's going to have to property and this is going to be two forward

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,660
slash posts and we already have that that path which is going to be posts right here posts and it's

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,960
going to be post for Slash and then maybe number one and they're going to have the two and the three.

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,070
So I'm going to go and paste it.

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,300
It's going to be two and three.

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:23,890
OK.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,040
So let's go to home.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,700
Going to go home.

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,790
I want to go to posts so I'm going to get my post-box number one post number two and post number three.

29
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,210
Of course we need to add a break just to make it a little bit better.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,570
And there we go.

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,040
So OK we have this list so I'm going to click and post number one and it's going to go to local host

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,490
for I-Slash posts for Slash and number one.

33
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,380
This is going to be the idea of our post.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,100
Now the thing is that whenever you go to this route I want to fetch the data that belongs to this post

35
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,890
to the ID number one.

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,830
And if we go right here we are only getting whatever it's inside post.

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,290
We're getting the on the route.

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,250
This route.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,140
So what we need to do we need a way to create.

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,750
We need to create a model that it's going to be listening for this route and then it's going to render

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,490
the data that we have for post number one.

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,870
OK.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,410
So I'm going to create that route.

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,240
And again I'm going somewhere.

45
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,250
Don't worry we're going to create a new file and this one is going to be on no post item makes sense.

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,460
Most of that has got so inside post item pretty much we're going to have the same thing than this going

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,270
to go to post.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,360
Item the lead and right here and going to say post detail.

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,170
We don't need the link right here and we need to pass to create this to put a different name.

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,430
So let's put.

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,500
Post item.

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,340
Of course we need to export it and we need to require this file from the index so we can require the

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,930
path.

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,350
So I'm going to say import and then post post item.

55
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,330
Very good.

56
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,680
It's going to be from and then dash components and then for Slash and then post item.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,020
Okay.

58
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,400
So this route is ready.

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,680
So now I'm going to create a post I'm sorry I'm going to carry it around for this.

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,950
I got a copy of this pasted at the bottom and we're going to say whenever we get a post with ID and

61
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,610
in this case let's pretend that we won the one the number one begin to be using the route for post.

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,290
And we're going to be using this component but it's just an out.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,690
So if we go to post one you're getting posts and we're getting one but you know we are getting the PPOs

64
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,620
detail we are getting that component.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,870
We are getting that text but we're still getting the post the main parent component.

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,780
And the thing is that both routes have posts.

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,180
So what we need to do to this one we need to say exact.

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,530
So now we are getting the post detail.

69
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,990
Now the thing is that right now this ID it's hard coded in and realized this ID is going to be dynamic

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,890
you could be receiving a request for a post number one post number to post 56 or whatever.

71
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,420
And notice that right here I'm doing 56 but this is not working because I'm the we have the number one

72
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,260
hardcoded.

73
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:33,660
So we need to find a way to make this field dynamic and this are called Perhaps we need to be use of

74
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,200
feature from react to use perhaps.

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,760
Now to past dynamic data to listen for dynamic data right here we're going to use the common currency

76
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,680
con and then whatever we want to listen.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,820
In this case we are passing an ID so I'm going to say Id Now if I do id I have 6:56 56 right here but

78
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm still getting the post detail.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,540
If you go to post detail you know we just have a text it's a loading this.

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,160
So you know it's working.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,250
Whenever used con you're meaning you're saying that you want to use that dynamic value right here and

82
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,930
this could be whatever you want.

83
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,600
Let me say that first we wanted the I.D. and then for example a user name something like that.

84
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,840
Of course nothing is going to happen because we need a user name.

85
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,230
I'm going to say the username of this guy is going to be Francis and it's going to load that data is

86
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,200
going to load that component because we have a match right here.

87
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,990
So another thing is that OK we are passing dynamic data.

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,420
How can we catch it inside here.

89
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,330
How can we get that data.

90
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,960
Because whenever you get a request for this you're going to enter this component this view and you need

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,910
to grab the fifth the sixth the Francis and then you need to go to the database do whatever you need

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,620
to do and render that post.

93
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:58,540
Well remember that we talked about the browser router and everything else that whenever we use re-act

94
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,520
router is going to pass all the options inside prompts.

95
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:10,660
Well same idea are going to go right here and say props and of course if I do console log and then prompts

96
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,940
me bring the console.

97
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,980
Make this a little bit bigger.

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
No that's fine.

99
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:23,620
So I'm going to be doing log the prompts an inside match right here just like before we have all the

100
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,990
data for this and right here you have perhaps you have the ID and the username.

101
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:40,630
So right here what we could say OK to do just render the prop's dot match dot programs dot ID in this

102
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,250
case and I I to do the same thing for the username.

103
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,760
Let's put it right here.

104
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,850
It is a DOS and then perhaps and then username.

105
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,630
So in our time we load around with dynamic data we are catching that data and then you can do whatever

106
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,950
you wish right here.

107
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,320
Let's put something else let's say 8 8 8 and then Janice whatever.

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,120
So we get the data you always get the information you're getting.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,680
You said we are router is going to pass the information inside prompts.

110
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,090
So you know prompts are really really important for us to pass information between components.

111
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,780
So you're going to be using this the whole time.

112
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,360
We're going to be using this the whole time.

113
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,480
So let's go to a different topic right now.

114
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,130
OK so now I'm going to show you some additional features of re-act router.

115
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,250
Now instead of using browser router just like you're using right here we could use an alternative wave

116
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,210
to manipulate the L.

117
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:48,310
We get on top for example instead of bringing the browser router I'm going to say hash router just like

118
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,990
that hash Roder.

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,030
So this one is going to make the URL a little bit different and notice that you're getting an error

120
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,550
message browser router.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,060
It's not defined.

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,910
And the thing is that if we use this one we cannot use browser router right here.

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,210
We need to replace this for hash router.

124
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,280
And if it were the page you're getting it and notice that at the end of the year you're all the domain

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
domain domain.

126
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,700
So we are getting a hash stack and then for Slash.

127
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,890
So whenever we use this the u r l is going to be built just like this.

128
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,170
If I go to posts after the hash tag then you get the Euro.

129
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,040
If I go to profile you know we get profile hash tag and then profile.

130
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,240
So this is the way it works with this.

131
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,110
So you know again it depends on what you're building and what you want to do if you want to use the

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,700
normal your L or then hash tag for Shlash of L.

133
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,430
This was very common with the first versions of angular I use this lot.

134
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,200
So OK.

135
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:54,880
We have another one that is going to be called Memory router and by the keyboard memory you can guess

136
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,680
what this is going to do.

137
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,470
So whenever we use memory router instead of getting a urinal you're not going to get anything.

138
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,330
Everything is going to be stored in memory.

139
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,330
You know it's not going to change the L or is not going to show you what you're getting.

140
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:16,870
If I go home we get home if I go to posts we are getting the posts new posts but nothing is going to

141
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,380
happen to the euro.

142
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,340
When got it just like I told before.

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,250
This depends on what you're building.

144
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:33,030
In my opinion the the browser router is the best because now everyone it's familiar with this with the

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,560
L and is certain that most people whenever they use change something or do something.

146
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,640
They look at the out and having the Ural with the directories and everything else.

147
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,470
It's really really useful.

148
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,230
So most of the times you going to be using browser Roder But it's it's good to know that we have different

149
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,040
choices right here.

150
00:09:52,330 --> 00:10:00,180
OK so moving on instead of just using rgle links for the header to right here we have a different option.

151
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,390
We have Browder's gonna give us something that is going to be called nav link if you want to.

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,920
We want to use a navigation bar just like this.

153
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,820
We can bring something that is going to be called Knobloch so Napp link is going to create a navigation

154
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,920
for you.

155
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,430
Just as with the link.

156
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,690
The option to use links with that link.

157
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,240
But you have some additional options I'm going to change all of this to now blank and then same thing

158
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,550
right here.

159
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,600
OK.

160
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,990
And of course if I were the page nothing happens.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,140
Everything stays the same.

162
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,060
But for example with nobbling you get some additional options.

163
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,450
Let me just break it down so instead of.

164
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,370
Well besides the two you have one option that is going to be active style so you can choose which color

165
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,870
this link is going to show whenever it's active.

166
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
In this case I'm going to say color.

167
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,470
Sorry I meant a mistake inside the double curly braces.

168
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm going to say color.

169
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,850
I'm going to say read it of course.

170
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,480
Notice that this is just a.

171
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,600
So if I go to home get nothing if I go to posts.

172
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,770
Notice that the posts it's highlighted so is changing the color.

173
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,770
Lets me inspect this.

174
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,430
We get the color color red and if we go right here we have style and color red.

175
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,490
So this is just the styling for this.

176
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,510
But you know it's a nice option that we can use that we can use the styles we can use classes instead

177
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,440
of active style.

178
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:41,650
Going to say active was active class name I believe active and then class name so same thing.

179
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,740
We can pass a class the name of class.

180
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,030
So in this case I'm going to say select it just like that selected.

181
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:57,490
Of course if we were little the page and I inspect posts link are going to get the class of selected

182
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,870
whenever it's selected.

183
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,770
And if I go home of course we don't have that class so that's good.

184
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,520
This is good.

185
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,800
To use nice to use and nice to know that we have this feature.

186
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,250
Would react router.

187
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,980
OK so let's move to the next topic.

188
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,730
We're going to be talking about Riak routers switch is going to be short a short one.

189
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,080
It's really useful.

190
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:25,090
So if you know about Riak routers switch just go to the next section.

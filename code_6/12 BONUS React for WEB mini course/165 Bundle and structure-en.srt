1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,470
So when you work with react or enage single page applications you're going to have a lot of files.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,390
But what the user sees on the screen is going to be something else something different.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,960
So let me bring you a chart right here.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,460
So in one hand you can have your application right here.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,080
So your application of course is going to contain a lot of files a lot of javascript and different files.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,060
Let's get you could have hundreds of files then whenever you need to finish your project and you need

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,660
to publish to put it inside production you're going to be using web Pech and vavle and web pack and

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,820
battle is going to grab all your project is going to compile everything and then is going to give you

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,370
just a couple files.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,620
You can have two or three or maybe a little bit more but just a few files.

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,520
So this index is going to be what the browser is going to be using is going to be seeing on the screen

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,700
and all your code or your application code is going to be bundled into one.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,040
So battle and well-padded they're going to merge all your code and put it in some inside something that

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,210
calls bundle that D.S..

15
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,330
Now the bundle the name.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,060
It's my convention bundle you can use you can use whatever name you want to react and create the app

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,880
is going to do this job.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,750
And it's going to stored inside Vandel that has some mean exit right here.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,040
So we have our application.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,860
This one is the one we have right here.

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,710
We know that.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,550
So if I do right click and I do inspect is going to give me the console and right here we can have that

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,610
actual Dom.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,170
If I go to the header you can have a few tacks the fight the con Condon the styles and whatever.

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:49,280
Now if I scroll down and go to the body you can have a script and notice that right here we have a bundle

26
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,350
that jast.

27
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,460
So all the code for this application it's merge into one.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:02,960
Let me just do a right click and let me go right here to network and reload the page again and this

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Varndell that Jesus is going to be a bunch of files.

30
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,250
A lot of a lot of code bundled into one.

31
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,520
Right here we have all the code and this is going to be a really long coat of course and it's going

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,930
to get longer of course.

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,460
OK.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,670
Let me close it.

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,730
So Noda know that whenever you work with react or single any single page application you're going to

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,050
be using just a bundle.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,860
Yes.

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:36,050
And for now we are now going to learn how to do this by hand because we're using create re-act app and

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,850
create re-act up is going to do it for us.

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,900
But then when we reached the web pack section of the course we're going to do this Vandel manually.

41
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,500
OK.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,260
So let's keep moving forward.

43
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,500
Right.

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,930
So let's talk a little bit of what's happening with the project structure.

45
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,480
So on top of the chain let me make this bigger just like here on top of the chain we have the node modules

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,930
here are all the dependencies that our project is going to need.

47
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,540
So if our project works is because we have the node modules.

48
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,560
So this is kind of the vendor folder.

49
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,480
If I open this can see a lot of files.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,070
That's why it's taking a lot of time in installing and creating the re-act app.

51
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,030
It's installing all the dependencies for our project.

52
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,100
So OK we can have a bunch of files.

53
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,730
If you do this one nothing is going to work.

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,700
So think of this the node modules as the vendor folder.

55
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,640
Every piece of code you use from different developers is going to be right here just like we act and

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,950
everything else.

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,570
So then at the bottom of the chain we can have the package that Jason.

58
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,370
Let me make this better.

59
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,630
So the package that Jason is going to be the manifest for your project all the information about the

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,810
project modules just like nobody else and dependencies you're going to use is going to be listed right

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,760
here right here and dependencies.

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,230
We have re-act react Domm the name of the project.

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,700
It's one reac basics version and everything else.

64
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,460
And then of course you can have the scripts folder.

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,080
So this is what we're going to do what node is going to be listening to start the application remember

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,550
to start this.

67
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,860
We did NPM start this one.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,010
We are doing NPM.

69
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,160
It's entering here start and it's starting the development server.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,030
Good.

71
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,960
So we're going to be talking more about commands when we reach the notes section of the course but this

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,300
file it's really important.

73
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,090
And this is not a re-act file.

74
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,100
It's going to be a node jast file got me close.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
Yes.

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,770
OK.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,200
So then we have the public folder and the source folder.

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,480
So the important part of the public for there is going to be the index.

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,910
H Tim L So this index HMO is going to be what it's going to be rendered on the screen it's what we get

80
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,170
right here with the bundle that jazz and everything else.

81
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Now the funny thing about this is that if I scroll down right here let me make it smaller.

82
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,100
We didn't have a bundled digest just like we have right here.

83
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,040
So what is happening why we are getting the bundle jast inside the HDMI out on the browser.

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,200
Not right here.

85
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:27,670
Well whenever you do NPM start re-act they create we act app and we pack are going to build a development's

86
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,320
server.

87
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,310
So the server is going to be something that can happen behind the scenes and what you see right here

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,660
is going to be rendered from memory.

89
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,520
It's not using the actual files.

90
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,160
It's building everything storing in memory and then you get this because you are in a development server.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,770
Then whenever you go to production it's going to run web pack is going to create build and you're going

92
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,380
to see that that bundled that J.

93
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,920
So right here you get no development build.

94
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,140
It's not optimized then to create a production build.

95
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,260
We need to use a different command not NPM start but am pm on built and we're going to get this at the

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,070
end of this section.

97
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,830
OK.

98
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,780
Then the second folder is going to be the source folder.

99
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,860
We have it right here.

100
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,150
Make it bigger so we can have ab you know with the C Ss the javascript attached and everything else.

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,810
We're not going to be using a lot of files right here.

102
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,950
Now one of the files is going to be really important the index that has an inside the source begin to

103
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,550
store all the files for our application.

104
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,710
But the main file.

105
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,600
The one that that starts the application is going to be the index that G-S.

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,510
So this file is going to start everything for us inside our application and we're going to be using

107
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,830
this one of course.

108
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,020
OK that's good.

109
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,250
Let's go to the next section and keep moving forward.

1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,820
So let's do the grits.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,940
It's going to be really fast if you're feeling lazy than we need first up to the degree it's just like

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,580
this.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,500
We need the actual icons.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,450
So we need to bring the icons.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,340
And again if you're listening if you're feeling a little bit lazy just like me you can go to Budenz

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,610
inside you tildes and copy the import.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,140
Yes I'm cheating.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,350
I'm going to paste it right here.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,050
So for fun.

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,650
Awesome.

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,120
That's Day One we need and this one of course we need something else is going to be a and then bars

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,440
just like this change on the free solid.

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,110
I'm going to copy this one and this one.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,710
It's going to be F A T H.

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,050
Right.

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,530
So there you go.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,270
You're done.

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,080
Let's go at the bottom to the container of the grits which is chopped grits and right here.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,840
We need actually two elements.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,430
You know the left and the right.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,730
Pretty much it's.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,090
So I'm going to create a them open and close.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,220
Now this div..

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,140
We need to pass some things because whenever we click it we want to do something.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,730
And besides we want to change the class names to greyed out or not grade out.

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,930
All right.

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,040
So I'm going to add a class name.

30
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,320
I could close this because we need to see pretty much everything.

31
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,380
So I'm going to use a template strings and I'm going to say the good the style of this is greed VTM

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,140
right.

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,990
Then if the grid that we state of grid that we have at the top this one has a value you know a name

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,670
where class whatever we want to attach it there.

35
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:42,120
You know we want to check if we have something and if we do have something we want to attach a class

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,970
of active.

37
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,320
So we go record one and say OK open it clubs.

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,810
If this state that the grid has something we're going to do this.

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,300
If not we're going to do active.

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,510
Right.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,100
And he said Oh and I will attach a class the unclick listener that we're going to do in a minute.

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,450
So unclick and whenever we click it we want to trigger a function called handle and then a grid can

43
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,040
be so simple and it's out of here.

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,090
We need to do the fun.

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:26,190
Awesome so font awesome on the closet and the icon it's equal to f a th Breguet.

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,720
So I'm going to copy all this and paste it at the bottom.

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
Of course we need to change some things because now the state the class active is going to be expecting

48
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,520
for it not only of this I can put this in front and that is that now the handle Gretz still is that

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,920
we just need to handle Gritz because we just tackle something.

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,000
And this one it's a.

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
And then bars that is it.

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,190
So now we need to create to handle grid function.

53
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,930
So we're going to go right here at the top.

54
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,620
I'm going to say it calls handle Gred opening close.

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,990
Now the handle grid is just going to set the state of something or it's just going click it.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,870
So I'm going to say this.

57
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,430
That said state opening close grid.

58
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,630
And now if we don't have anything inside this let me do this first.

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,500
This state that grid.

60
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,950
What are we going to do.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,160
We're going to return grid underscore bars.

62
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,060
Right.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,100
If we do have something we not going to do anything.

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,450
And you're not going to do anything.

65
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,130
We just toggling between a class and not a class.

66
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,700
Now if you remember whenever we make or we include the component for the cards we are passing the state

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,650
of grit so the cards are going to get a class of Man-Thing or the great bars.

68
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,920
This is a class.

69
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,820
So at the bottom for example load cards we get grid that the state quits.

70
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,460
So the cars will be getting a class or nothing.

71
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,860
Now if I go to cart I have it right here.

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,940
We say that we are passing of course the props and everything else you say OK I want to get the credit.

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,090
So this is going to be a class or it's going to be nothing.

74
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,760
So if you're going to go to our project yes and get to select it ok.

75
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,980
Change in the grids.

76
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,570
But it's a little bit broken.

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,190
So of course I've already checked on this one a possible deal.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,010
And of course check out what is the problem.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
And I made a couple mistakes.

80
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,830
First I'm going to go to the cart component and right here I've closed the container so this should

81
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,990
be inside of a container.

82
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,060
Now I'm going to put this right here.

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,820
All right.

84
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,780
Now I'm going to go to Lloyd Gibson.

85
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,110
Lorem Ipsum Actually I'm going to fit into real content right here.

86
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,190
We are just under description because now we are going to be showing us we are showing pretty much nothing.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,830
So I'm going to put a paragraph right here p tack and I'm going to bring the props that description

88
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,670
that comes from the actual server.

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,770
So corruption.

90
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,300
All right.

91
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,470
Let's try it again.

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,470
So the application reloads.

93
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,030
And if you go here now we get it.

94
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,450
Now there's one more one more mistake.

95
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm going to delete this.

96
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,370
I'm going to type whatever

97
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:17,760
I'm going to.

98
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,010
I'm going to reload the application go here.

99
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,250
And of course the class for this one is wrong because the image should be you know should be a little

100
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,430
bit smaller.

101
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,250
We are setting.

102
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,960
I didn't change the default image.

103
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,310
So of course if we bring it down it fits.

104
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,690
Now if you want to do this on the styles on the card I think were great bars.

105
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,820
You can you can actually do it.

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,580
No problem.

107
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm not going to do it.

108
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,700
I'm going to leave it just like it is.

109
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,730
Because again the CSSA are not that important right here of course.

110
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,210
Yes because it's really actually.

111
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,380
But again we are not focus focusing a lot of the on the C Ss.

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,710
Like I said before don't take the CSSA as a reference.

113
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,590
OK.

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,750
So we are changing the grid and everything works.

115
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,410
Everything works right.

116
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,700
Later I might be adding some more more filters but for now we are done with this.

117
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,730
We are done with a shop section of course later are we going to do the add to the car but you know that

118
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,600
that logic comes from the actual cart and the user the user data.

119
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,220
Right.

120
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,400
So we are done with this.

121
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,920
Let's move on to the next section.

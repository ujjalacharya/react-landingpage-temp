1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,180
So let's keep moving forward.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,100
Right now we're going to be doing the ad products section beginning go to the log in since we are our

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,040
admins we're going to get this option we're going to create this part for the app.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,950
And then when we click our products we're going to go to here.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,480
So it is pretty much a form just a form.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,560
We did a lot of this.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,620
So we need to do it again of course but it's going to be very simple this time.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,600
And then at the end we can add the upload image and we're going to use this we can upload to a service

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,950
much much later.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,100
And I've already wrote this down on a note as a bonus to this project.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,620
I will add pretty much the same behavior than uploading an image but to you know to our directories

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,040
to our server instead of using everything as a service I would still recommend doing this service and

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,090
you have a bunch of a bunch of services for this.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,010
You can even use firebase for this.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,630
Yeah.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,730
So OK.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,370
So after after we do this before doing this we need to do the nap now before doing the nav.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,880
I want to give you I want to tell you something I forgot to do from our project right here.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
What we did right here.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,200
Now let me go here and to the road 380 and I'm going to check the last entry.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,050
It's a 700.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,260
So this is the one we get right here.

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,460
Seven hundred and the public for this one.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,300
It's false.

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,200
So we shouldn't be getting this image.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,880
I forgot to block this.

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,180
Now there's two ways you can do it.

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,350
You can go to the carts and say Dude if it's published false don't show it.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,940
That's it.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,190
But you will still be loading the from this.

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,260
The actual data from this product.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,290
So what you can do you can go to the service to the server to the route.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:54,590
Actually whenever you reload this routes there's a product you can enter and pie and pass a new arc.

34
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,300
For example going to go right here and we're going to say find Arkes and the key for this is going to

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,760
be publish just like this publish.

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:10,210
So I'm just adding the art I'm going to say publish and.

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,040
And the art and say OK I want to bring all the files as long as they are true just like this.

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,560
And this is a public route so you can do whatever you want right here and you're not using the admin

39
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,940
of course if you use the admin you're going to block everything if the user is not locked in.

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,000
That is a problem.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,280
So if reload this used not there anymore it's just blocking the products that are not published.

42
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,020
That is it.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
That is the only thing you're doing.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,300
And of course later if you want to fetch things from the server and they need to be admin you maybe

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,380
need to export this and create a function maybe and then create a different route or modify the hour

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,510
an admin so you can put it right here.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,950
But you know that's not a good idea.

48
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,400
All right let's get.

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,970
So we're going to do this right now.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,830
So we need to create the route I'm going to go to my account.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
We need to create the NAF right here.

52
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,640
So I'm going to close everything.

53
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,370
We don't need it and I'm going to go where we have this now which is going to be user inside h o z.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,390
OK.

55
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:23,550
Just like the links we need to add a new viable Konst and I'm going to call it admin equals right because

56
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,530
the admin section open and close.

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,410
They're going to copy this one and paste it right here.

58
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,670
Now the first one it's going to be the site info.

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,020
So site and then info.

60
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:43,670
So this one this one we will be able to change some things on on the on the side to the global bbls

61
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,270
but that's got to do it later.

62
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,770
It's just some information about the above the Web site.

63
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,450
OK.

64
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,550
So then I'm going to go to app products which is the one we're going to be using right now an advent

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,870
inside info no it's going to be a product.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,830
All right.

67
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,380
And I'm going to copy this one.

68
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,060
Go with the bottom and paste it.

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,760
And this one is going to be managed categories later.

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,400
Of course we need a place where we can enter brands or what so we'll create a tiny little thing for

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,210
this.

72
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:22,420
So manage categories and instead of admen it's going to be manage categories.

73
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:22,980
OK.

74
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,500
So we are pretty much done.

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,700
Now the thing is and the promise that we want to show this is show this only if the user is authenticated.

76
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,390
And remember that the South is a different agency so it's kind of an a different place.

77
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,550
We cannot really really use it right here.

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,790
We could but I prefer to do something else since we have all everything injected in Propst after we

79
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,850
load this component because this is the wrapper of a parent print component that actually it's inside

80
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,560
the router.

81
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,310
What we can do.

82
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,320
We could just written redux right.

83
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,500
We can bring the maps data to props and get and get it from there.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,990
So I'm going to say map state to props to the own prompts and begin to bring user user.

85
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,210
And I'm going to say user right.

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,030
Of course we need to bring connect on the top.

87
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,950
So import import than it connect just like this.

88
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,380
When they make it right connect to connect and then from re-act redux.

89
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,080
Right of course we need to wrap everything inside of here.

90
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,470
And now we have reductions here so we can access the maps data props.

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,440
Of course we need we need to go we need to pass the maps stage props.

92
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,420
Forgot to do that.

93
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,560
All right.

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,030
So now of course it will make a reference to Propst inside of there is here we can access the data.

95
00:05:51,170 --> 00:06:00,950
So I'm going to go below this and I'm going to say if prop's that user that user data remember that

96
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,300
we have it inside user data user data done.

97
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,680
And we have as admin then begin to show it.

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,000
So if not we going to do no good you know same as always.

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:23,030
So now I'm going to go right here and enter a new div and the it will contain an H2 called Atman.

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:30,190
And inside of here are going to create a new div with a class name of links just like with it before.

101
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,740
Notice at the top we pretty much have the same thing.

102
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,780
I'm just going to copy and OK now it's going to be GeneDx links.

103
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,030
But in this case it's going to be admin you know a different list.

104
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,170
So if we check it we have the admin and everything else.

105
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,680
So that's good right now.

106
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,100
Later of course we shouldn't be getting this right.

107
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,280
If you're not anatman but remember that we're going to be going to be using anatman out.

108
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,380
We are actually using the admin.

109
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,420
So if we want to poll the user you can break this and enter and tried to post something.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,260
It's not going to really happen unless they have the correct token.

111
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,210
OK.

112
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,680
So if we go to our product we have this route.

113
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,030
We don't have the route defined Let's create it.

114
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,630
So what are we going to do.

115
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,260
We're going to go inside user because this is in use or use around.

116
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,530
So I'm going to go inside and I'm going to create a new directory called outman and instead of admen

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,110
of course we will have this at products that.

118
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:36,790
All right.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,500
Of course this is going to be a re-act class based component.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,540
We need to do a lot of things right here.

121
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,200
So I'm going to call it ad products product in real life product.

122
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,620
We just enter a single product from here.

123
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,120
OK.

124
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,740
So our product and our product that's the same thing as product.

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,350
So now of course we need to add the route.

126
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,210
And we're going to do this.

127
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,590
And then just move on to the next section so we can start from scratch with the product.

128
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,190
All right.

129
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,880
So I'm going to go two routes and I'm going to include it.

130
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,230
Import product from that forward slash components forward slash user.

131
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,720
And then Aben forward slash and end product.

132
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,200
All right.

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,310
So I'm going to copy the same dashboard route because it's had been round and noticed that I'm putting

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,180
all the things right here in the last public or semipublic right here.

135
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:44,550
So it's instead of user it's admen and it's add product and product.

136
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,930
They're going to copy the name of the component paste it and in theory we should be getting the product

137
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,730
and we can do of course we didn't have the Napp we need to add it right now.

138
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,000
But we are pretty much ready to start doing this.

139
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,920
So let's go to the next section and we will start with the easy part which is going to be creating the

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,980
state bringing the lay out you know all the imports and then and adding the form fields.

141
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,580
That is the easy part.

142
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,060
So let's go to the next section into this.

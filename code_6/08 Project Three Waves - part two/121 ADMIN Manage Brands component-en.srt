1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,500
OK so now we can do the managed categories.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,100
So if I go to manage categories of course we don't get anything but we will get the user lay out and

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,840
we will add categories just like DeFrantz and the woods.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,400
And we will create two different components because they are two different models.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,070
And then of course we will create a new component that will rule them all.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,370
Just like The Lord Of The Rings now we are not going to do anything new.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,020
Not at all.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,230
Hear it's going to create forums and update you know the state and go to probs.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,710
We already did this.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,010
You're not going to learn anything new right here.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,100
So if you wish for it that you manage France and the manager woods you just can go to the section where

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,620
we move forward of a different to a different topic and you just can copy the code and you know get

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:46,950
it done.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,550
If you don't want to do it again you're are not learning anything you write here.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,290
Right now you're not going to learn.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,190
So OK.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,470
So if you still want to do what I want to do with me of course you have the chance of do it.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,260
So first we need to create a ramp for this and a component that will rule everything.

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:12,360
So I'm going to go inside admin and create new file called manage and then categories that jazz let

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,040
me do it right.

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,320
Taggart's So this is going to be a reacts.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,870
The last component just like that and then manage categories.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:32,130
All right of course we need to use a user layout so import user layout from and are going to do capital

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,610
L or we go from and it's dot dot for Slash.

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,410
One more time one more time.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,650
And then we get a chose C and then for Slash and then user.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,310
Now we will have two different components.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,830
We need to include it right now so I'm going to create the components right now and wrap everything

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,310
inside the user layout.

30
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,870
So I'm going to go to admen create a new file starts in the same way with manager underscore and there

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,900
will be categories that G-S and I are to create a new one called manage.

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,030
And then what's that jazz.

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:18,440
First we're going to do the manage the Manage Oh and same name is going to be mench brands.

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm sorry if this so let me just open the one that it's empty and it's kind of weird that it led me

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,050
at the same name.

36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,490
This is not very common.

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,080
So I'm going to delete categories and say brands.

38
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,110
This is what we're going to be doing here.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,110
OK.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:46,470
So instead of here I'm going to import the manage and then Brant's from Dad forward slash and then match.

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,370
France and the same thing with the other one but it's going to be managed.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,310
It's so simple right now manage what's right.

43
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,610
Of course I need to include them right here so I'm going to make a reference to this manage brands and

44
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,940
then manage what could be managed Woods plural OK.

45
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,840
Now I'm going to go to manage Brant's creed every act class based component because they are going to

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,340
be a class and then say manage.

47
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,370
And then Brant's same thing and are going to go to manage woods and do pretty much the same things are

48
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,020
going to copy and paste.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,130
And this one is going to be words woods and then brands.

50
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,500
Oh sorry what's And what's OK.

51
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,510
So on this one I'm going to say a word and the other one.

52
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,540
It's brand.

53
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,310
Right.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,670
So at least we can get something on the screen.

55
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,210
Of course we need to create a route.

56
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:51,250
So let's go two routes and we need to include the first the parent component we'll just manage categories.

57
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,920
So import MENASCHE categories.

58
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,810
Right.

59
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,530
It's from that forward slash components for Slash.

60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,610
We go inside user we go inside admen and then managed categories.

61
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,380
Now this is going to be a restricted restricted route.

62
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:18,830
So I'm going to go to the upper part and then it's admen and then manage categories.

63
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,520
And of course we use the correct components manage.

64
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,650
I mean the mistake right here.

65
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,080
Manage categories manage categories Burguet.

66
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,800
So we get Brant's or I've managed categories.

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,210
We are not getting the check why this is why it save the file.

68
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,080
So it's going to reload and get brands and books.

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,480
OK.

70
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,630
So let's begin with Brandt's.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,410
This is for simple.

72
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,250
We need to import a lot of things and most of the things we've already kind of did this.

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,670
So if we go to add product could it go at the top and we need a few things from here.

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,150
Right.

75
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,670
We need to form fields.

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,370
We need to update that we need to form actions are going to go and paste it and from different actions

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,890
we need the update to generate data and that is form ballot.

78
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,280
And the reset fields that populate options not really we don't need it.

79
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,040
We will use connect.

80
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,130
So I'm going to import connect and then action products.

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,290
They're going to copy that code and paste it.

82
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,280
Now here are the bomb.

83
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm going to leave the app open because we can begin to use it in a couple of minutes.

84
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,730
So right now we just need to use get France from here.

85
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:35,330
It's going to delete everything else later we can any to create a new a new dispatch in your function

86
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,910
so we can add a brand because we don't have that route.

87
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,750
We have the route on server but we don't have a function.

88
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:50,840
So we need to state again we are working with forums so we're going to create a state and now the state

89
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,320
is going to be very simple.

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,920
We have a form for a forum success and we still get a form data.

91
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,310
So I'm going to go and copy this.

92
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,780
And of course close the form data.

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,080
So the only thing we add is the name of the brand.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,520
So again going copy name I'm going to go back to France and then paste it.

95
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,600
And that is it.

96
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,800
This was fast.

97
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,390
All right.

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,630
The only thing we need to do is to change the attack which is going to be I don't know brand name.

99
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:30,600
And then of course brand and we are using name and not brand because among geuss we store this name

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,510
inside the brand model enter you enter the brand.

101
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,970
Required true but false touch false and show label could be true.

102
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,950
That's fine.

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,260
You're not going to use showily or just going to delete it and the labels well.

104
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:57,580
OK so now what we need to do first I would like to show the existing brands right here and in the ride

105
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,880
I would like to get an input so I can you know select that out of brand and then it will be reflected

106
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,790
right here.

107
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,210
That's what we're going to be doing.

108
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,980
So of course we need some kind of a layout for this.

109
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,930
So let's go to the upper.

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,390
The bottom of the render right here.

111
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:23,130
I'm going to add a class name and the class name it's admin underscore category underscore wrapper or.

112
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:30,660
And of course I'm going to add a title of brands and I'm going to wrap some are going to put up one

113
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,590
more wrapper.

114
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,910
So a class name equals to admen underscore to and that it column.

115
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,370
OK so we can get inside of each column two sides.

116
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,560
The one of the left and the one in the right.

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,950
So I need to create a left in it.

118
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,730
Right.

119
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,830
So class name laughed and the old one the other one.

120
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,980
It's going to be right.

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,750
So on the right one will get the forms I'm going to say.

122
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,130
Right and I'm going to type o form whatever.

123
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,900
Now what I want to do I want to render a container with all the brands.

124
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,560
So I'm going to create a div very simple class name.

125
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,740
And again to say Brant's capital.

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,870
Sorry plural.

127
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,490
And then container.

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,060
Now of course we are not going to get anything right here.

129
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,340
But you know right now we can see that we got something right here.

130
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,100
H.H. but that's OK.

131
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,730
So I want to render all of this inside of a function.

132
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,690
So this show category and that items.

133
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,220
This is the name of my function you can call this whatever you want.

134
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,950
So I'm going to say equal to a function and then of course we will do something.

135
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:54,270
So what we will need to do here is to graph the brands we have inside of the inside of the props.

136
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,120
We can do a request.

137
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:03,090
Get a triggered this get Brandt's begin to get the brands and once they are inside Propst we can grab

138
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,240
the props and we can loop them right.

139
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,740
All right.

140
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,020
Very very simple.

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,290
I already did this.

142
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,690
So of course right here we will return some GSX.

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,740
But for now it's just going to leave like this because we're going to do it in a minute.

144
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,740
First we're going to do the request of getting the Brandts.

145
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,670
OK.

146
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,460
So I'm going to go right here the one and we need to do component mount opening close.

147
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm going to make a reference to this that props and then I get a dispatch something.

148
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,940
And I gotta get the operands.

149
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,100
Now there's that thing missing is that we don't have Connect frank here.

150
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,380
So this will never work.

151
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:50,620
So I'm going to go and say connect open and close and then we enclose the managed brands.

152
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,370
Right now we need the maps state of props to inject the prompts in this component.

153
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:03,840
So map state to prop's we don't need the prompts and this one will be going to products and we will

154
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,290
say state products and go in a little bit fast because guess again could it did this at this point.

155
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,660
It should be mastering all of this.

156
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,940
What we are doing.

157
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,790
So if we get the brands and in theory inside prompts we should be getting the state.

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,150
And we do we get Brandt's right here.

159
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,950
We'll be open and we have one two three four and we have many more.

160
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,450
All right.

161
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,120
OK.

162
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:36,960
So now we're going to get to grab the brands from these props that products that and brands.

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,760
Right.

164
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,390
And we can loop them inside of the show category.

165
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,570
That's why we are using that function.

166
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,370
So now we will be returning some GSX.

167
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:53,810
So we do this the probs that products that Brandt's And if we do get this we're going to return something.

168
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,740
If not you're not going to do anything because we don't have a valid rate.

169
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:06,920
So this prompts the products that Brandt's we could create a Konst someplace where we can store this

170
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,930
promise of products that Brandts or something like that.

171
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:20,240
So map up amp no map map opening close and we will be passing the item and iteration.

172
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:27,260
I don't know why every time I type item the iteration.

173
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,700
OK.

174
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,970
So we will be returning something simple.

175
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,920
It's just a div with like with an item inside.

176
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:43,870
So class name category item and we need to add a key and the key is going to be equal to item dot ID

177
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,310
underscore ID and the.

178
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,750
And then of course the name so item that name.

179
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,060
All right.

180
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,850
So this is going to loop whatever we have inside Brandt's and return a div for each and then we can

181
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,140
show it right here inside of a Brandt's container and that is what we get.

182
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,540
Right.

183
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,490
Very good.

184
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,930
We're not going to create a function to delete Brandt's because again it's really simple and you can

185
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,170
do it.

186
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,100
You can do it on your own.

187
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,030
No problem.

188
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,380
You shouldn't have a problem doing this.

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
So now we're going to do the inter brand.

190
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,730
Can it go in and create that form.

191
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,230
Right because we need to made a new brand.

192
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,360
So I'm going to go to the right and we're going to do the same thing then add products for now that

193
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:33,890
we go here which is save some time going to go to form.

194
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:39,090
I'm going to pace that and of course close the form.

195
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,390
Right.

196
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,110
That is that we don't have a submit form we're going to create in a minute now instead of here we just

197
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,360
get one single form element.

198
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,700
So I'm going to copy the form field of name because we have the same key so name is still name and everything

199
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,960
stays the same.

200
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,030
And I got a copy of the bond and we have the Erol labels.

201
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,770
So I'm going to copy this and paste it right here.

202
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,890
We could do a success but not going to do it.

203
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,390
So at product in theory is going to be at brand and then please check your data.

204
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,930
If you have a message again and we can add just as a success or a message or a success message right

205
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,960
here.

206
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,140
OK.

207
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,900
Everything looks nice.

208
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,330
Now we need to bring the uptick in the support for him because if not everything is going to fail.

209
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,920
And so far we are good.

210
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,370
You're getting the input.

211
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,750
All right.

212
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,000
So I'm going to go over here at the top on the products.

213
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,260
I'm going to copy the submit form and first the update form.

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,050
This is something that we really really need.

215
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,150
So going a pace that right here the top every time we update form this function will cooking an update

216
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,170
to it.

217
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,450
And of course it's not France I'm sorry it's not products it's going to be brands and everything else

218
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,650
stays same.

219
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,250
Same thing for the submit form.

220
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,160
So I'm going to copy submit.

221
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:08,910
Going to go to manage Brown's pasted at the bottom and right now we need to change Brant's right here.

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,820
I'm going to delete all of this and say console log data to submit.

223
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,010
Right.

224
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,380
So let's see what happens.

225
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:27,260
I'm going to go to the counsel law to the counsel actually counsel.

226
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,190
I'm going to type whatever and we get name whatever let's get.

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,660
Of course we need to reset a feel after we submit to form but we are not there yet.

228
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,030
So OK.

229
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,480
So why do we need to do now.

230
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:47,440
We need to create new action so we can dispatch and action and you know store something on the server.

231
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,580
And if you remember we already have that route.

232
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,860
So let me go here right here.

233
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,380
We have the post and the brand.

234
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,120
All right.

235
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,430
All right.

236
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,810
So let's do that right now.

237
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:09,280
So let's go to the actions when we find it prudent actions we need to create a type and I'm going to

238
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,000
call it ab brand right here we have to get get Branston going at it.

239
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:21,700
Just below that at brands could be brand because you know we are getting just one brand.

240
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,590
You're updating entery just one brand right.

241
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,490
Of course we don't have the time but I'm going to create right now.

242
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:39,410
I'm going to go here in after this export Export Konst brand and it's going to be at brand right.

243
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,170
Times.

244
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,250
We don't need any anymore.

245
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,460
So now I'm going to go where we have terrorists right here we have a terrorist and just below that get

246
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:55,490
France going to create the function to add a brand export function at brands opening close at brand

247
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,650
singler.

248
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:03,550
So we were going to get the data to have met and are going to add it right now I think and explain you

249
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,300
in a minute.

250
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,720
The existing brands brands.

251
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:16,570
So whenever we submit the foreign press submit right we go to the server and we're going to get only

252
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,380
one brand.

253
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,180
This is what's happening on the server.

254
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,670
We just returned that brand.

255
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,960
And the thing is that whenever you of course get return you need to update the state of France.

256
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,710
Remember that right here on the left we have a list of friends.

257
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,080
So well there's actually three three things you can do.

258
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:43,300
You can get the existing brands from the from the actual managed France ride that we get right here

259
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,060
from the company demand.

260
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:51,180
And you can merge the new brand that you just posted with the old brands and then return the whole state.

261
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,130
Right.

262
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,920
Or you can after that dispatch make a new request to get all the brands because.

263
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,820
But it makes no sense you're just making two requests or you can buy directly from the server whenever

264
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,810
you return something instead of returning a single brand.

265
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,600
Go to the brands and we turn the whole documents of France.

266
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,600
It's completely up to you.

267
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,720
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to merge the brands inside of the of the action right here.

268
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,800
So I'm got to create it right now.

269
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:28,320
We're not going to say Konst request equals X-posts post open and close.

270
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,220
There you are.

271
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:35,230
L is going to be pretty much the same parted server but it's Singler brand.

272
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,940
And then of course we pass that data to submit.

273
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,700
All right.

274
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,440
Then of course we will get a response.

275
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,110
Open and close again to do it here.

276
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,730
We get our response and response and I'm going to do something before I return something.

277
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,220
And just to clear that error.

278
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm going to say return opening close type.

279
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,870
We will use the time I believe was at brand brand.

280
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,890
Let me find it.

281
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:15,910
There we go at brand coma and the payload it's equal to whatever we get back from their request.

282
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,810
Now we're going to modify the request like it will be for maybe the server was down and you got a different

283
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,920
response if you got the success false.

284
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,940
So in real life I'm not going to do it right here to save time but in real life you should be checking

285
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,600
the response.

286
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,240
You know if it's false or if it's true before you push new elements maybe you want to send an error

287
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:42,630
message maybe the server was down and you want to show an error message maybe something else went wrong.

288
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,120
Right.

289
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,110
And that's why you get a success false.

290
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,640
Right.

291
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,770
So you should always catch the false error.

292
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,590
And of course whenever you do then then you need to catch the error from the server and not from the

293
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,400
action that you're creating.

294
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,530
We are not doing a lot of this just to save time again.

295
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,630
So I'm going to create a Barville called Brandt's and then dot dot dot and we will grab the existing

296
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,240
Brandt's and I'm going to push it right here.

297
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,730
Right.

298
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,440
So now brands contain all the existing brands not the new one that we get from the response that they're

299
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,830
going to do.

300
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,320
Coma they're going to attach whatever we get from Bruin's pawns.

301
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:27,250
Rhys pongs dot data dot and we are returning a keyboard with brand.

302
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,980
So I just merge everything.

303
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,880
And then at the end of course we return something.

304
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:38,520
So what I'm going to be returning is the success that we get back.

305
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,080
We are returning we get two things back to success is the brand.

306
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:52,520
So I will send attached a response that data that success that Acoma and whatever I get from brands.

307
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
All right that is good.

308
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,980
So our brand now we'll get a request with two properties success and brands.

309
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:07,370
So we need to go to the producer let me go to the reducers so we can pretty much fantasists product.

310
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:16,180
We do serve get Brandt's now we have brand and after brands are going to do it right here.

311
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:24,970
So pretty simple we just need to get the brand so case ad brand right then return open and close dot

312
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,800
dot dot state.

313
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,150
And now we remember that we have two things.

314
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,260
We have the brands right.

315
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,040
And we have the brand.

316
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,370
Remember.

317
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,010
OK.

318
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,750
So the brand is going to be the success pretty much.

319
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,560
So I'm going to say at brand so I'm going to put right here that the action you know everything was

320
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,530
successful.

321
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,150
You don't really need to do this but just in case I'm going to put that the success scenario and then

322
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,450
of course we have the Brant's remember that when we get Brandt's we are storing everything inside brands.

323
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,130
So I'm going to say OK I want to update brands as well with whatever we get from action that payload

324
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,490
and Brant's ride brands just like this.

325
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,770
Let me put it right here.

326
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,410
It's a little bit better.

327
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,480
All right.

328
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,740
And that is it when the server returns the response with the Brandt's.

329
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,070
Of course we are all very good at reading the probs.

330
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,230
So the list will get updated.

331
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,760
Right.

332
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,340
That's what should happen in a in a real life scenario.

333
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,550
I'm not sure if this is going to work.

334
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,320
Of course we might need to do some testing.

335
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,070
So let me add one more.

336
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,200
I don't know a different brand.

337
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,470
Whatever writer doesn't matter are going to add the brand name writer.

338
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,320
OK.

339
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,690
Of course we need to search for this.

340
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,710
We need to go to the Manage Brandt's and dispatched a proper reaction.

341
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,810
We are not doing anything just yet.

342
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,660
I believe it went too long really long.

343
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,890
So let's go to the next one.

344
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,870
The only thing left is to do this.

345
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,040
It's going to take take us like three four minutes and then we're going to do the woods and the woods.

346
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,400
It's pretty much the same code than this.

347
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,370
The only difference is that we need to create the do and everything else.

348
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,180
But it's pretty much the same code is going to take us five minutes.

349
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,370
Well let's go to the next one.

350
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:23,130
Finish with the words and then start with the I'm sorry fringed with the Brandts and then start with

351
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,730
the what's.

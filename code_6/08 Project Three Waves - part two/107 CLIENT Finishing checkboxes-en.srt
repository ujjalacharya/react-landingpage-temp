1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,610
All right so let's keep going with this.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,490
We are creating a list item right here.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,110
We're rendering a list of list item.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,450
Of course we don't have nothing inside.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,500
But instead of here we have at least eight list items.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,930
So instead of a list item we need to put the name of the item and the checkbox the actual checkbox.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,490
So inside list items we we're looking something I can add a key key because opening close and we get

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,370
it passing if you remember that whatever we have inside the value and the underscore ID which is the

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,350
ID that comes from the server.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,790
Then I'm going to put a file modify some of the stylings are going to change depending padding.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,610
Open and close some pixels and zero from the sides.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,760
Now instead of here we have two things.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,660
We have the text in the left and the checkbox in the right.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,280
So for this one we will be using a list item because we are using a list item but it's going to be an

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,040
item text so open and close.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,760
There we go.

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,350
So we need to pass the text that's going to go inside.

18
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:10,130
So this we do this but adding adding the primary so primary the primary is going to be whatever name

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,090
we get from the server.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,530
You know the name of the brand.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
So value that name.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,140
All right.

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,810
Then we need to add the checkbox and we cannot just add the checkbox right here because it's going to

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,650
get a little bit weird.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,090
We could add the checkbox but it's going to be here.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,350
So to put it in the other side of the you know the list item we can use that list item.

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,550
Secondary action.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,020
And it's going to go all the way to the right.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,640
So I'm going to wrap this inside the list.

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,620
Secondary action.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,390
Of course we need to open it close this.

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,440
So there you go.

33
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:55,070
So instead of here we need to put the checkbox so checkbox again self-closing tag.

34
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,030
And this one of course need some configuration.

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,890
First we're going to do the color and begin to set it to primary right.

36
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:07,670
The default color for a checkbox and then when two main things and everything that we're going to do

37
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,930
right now it's on the actual demo.

38
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,540
So it's on the documentation.

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,620
Of course you're going to do it one by one right here.

40
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,660
But if you have some doubts everything is on the demos.

41
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,400
All right.

42
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,470
So we hope we have two different properties.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,400
The onchange which is going to be a function and then the checked which could be a function but begin

44
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,540
to do it right here.

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,430
So if this checked.

46
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,450
It's true.

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,590
And first I'm going to add something here let's say console log.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,060
Hey we are not going to reinspected and just adding something to the change.

49
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,320
So if this checked is true it means that whenever the application whenever it renders that checkmark

50
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,350
is going to be true.

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,180
And of course if it's false it's not been show checked.

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,910
Right.

53
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,690
Makes sense.

54
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,950
But at least we get a list and the checkboxes.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,110
So what we need to do is that whenever we do change we need to.

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:09,150
We need to grab whatever value we have from this checkbox and added to the list of checked right here

57
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,200
we just push it back to that list.

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,880
So we need to create a function to rule this and then whenever we checked something to render with this

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,780
component we're going to check that state we're going to see if the I.D. of whatever we want to rent

60
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,990
to right here it's on that list and if it is of course we are going to we're going to do something we're

61
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,870
going to of course.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,930
So true or false.

63
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,230
That's what we can do.

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,200
And again everything is on the documentation.

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,460
So for now whenever we handle an and change what we will do is run a function or function.

66
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:47,660
So this handle Tuggle because we are toggling and we're going to use the IDs so I'm going to be passing

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,660
the you dot underscore ID.

68
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,450
All right.

69
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,780
So I'm going to copy the handle toggle I get to go right here on the bottom and says that handle toggle

70
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,610
equals whatever we get from value and then run something.

71
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,530
All right.

72
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:11,290
Brian a function and I'm doing this just just like the the documentation that we could use this on on

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,570
the on the usual way you know just a pad or a function.

74
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,350
OK.

75
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,560
So what are we going to do.

76
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,720
You're going to be doing.

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,310
So we are going to grab whenever we get back from this handle toggle we're going to create a copy of

78
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,540
the of the checked state.

79
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,330
Right.

80
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,390
And then we're going to store everything inside of course we need to do some modifications.

81
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:41,310
So this is just like we did with the with the forms to update the actual value of the input.

82
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,960
It's pretty much the same idea.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,870
So first I'm going to create a viral called this.

84
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,190
And again I'm going to go with the exact same we have in the documentation because maybe in future you

85
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,170
will read the documentation.

86
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,890
If you don't get this you can always you know get this video.

87
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,320
I can explain what is happening with this and why we're doing it like this.

88
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,080
We could do this on a different way because this is pretty much what we did with forms previously creating

89
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
a copy checking the copy.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,930
Then of course putting everything back to St..

91
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,670
So this is pretty much the same idea but on a different way.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,320
So I'm going to do this this that state now if you're not familiar with this going explain you right

93
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,920
now maybe you are and you can just move forward just a little bit.

94
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,620
So by this what we are doing is we're creating right here a Barville that it's good it's going to be

95
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,920
called checked and this checked is going to be equal to this state.

96
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,960
So this is kind of a shorthand of doing this next thing too is something like this.

97
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,990
There's that state checked.

98
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,310
So this is pretty much the same thing.

99
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,730
What we are doing we are accessing we creating a Marvel comic called checked and we are saying that

100
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,440
this when it's equal to whatever we have inside this state that check.

101
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,380
But this is of course the short version it's a different way to do it.

102
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,790
But they are pretty much the same thing.

103
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,490
So by this we are just reading the Bible saying that instead of here we want to put everything everything

104
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,990
that we have inside this that state that checked which is just an empty array for now.

105
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,600
All right.

106
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,700
Then I'm going to create a variable called Konst current and then index.

107
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:25,690
And this current index is going to be equal to whatever we have inside check checked.

108
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,370
And let me do it like this.

109
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:35,330
Checked and then dot and this is of course just pure javascript index off and Balli.

110
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:41,540
So what we are doing right here since we are going to get a value from the handle toggle with an ID.

111
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,960
You're entering the array of checks that we have inside of the state and we're checking if you have

112
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,600
the index of that particular value.

113
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,300
So when the index off you're going to enter an array and you can search for this if you have an entry

114
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,990
with the same ID with the same value.

115
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,240
If we do have any deal with the same value this one is going to be a negative number.

116
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,110
If we don't have that value on the list this one is going to be a positive number and is going to give

117
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,370
us the position of that value on the right.

118
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,400
All right either way right now it's going to be very clear.

119
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:22,790
So then I'm going to create a viable that is going to be called New checked and you checked and it's

120
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,600
equal to.

121
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,790
And again we make us on the range.

122
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,140
Just an empty array and we put everything inside we have inside check.

123
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,300
So if we had previews values we're going to create a new viable and put a check.

124
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,050
So again this one is just like this one you're just creating a new place so we don't mutate this again.

125
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,230
So if open and close we're going to do a conditional.

126
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,740
So now we need to evaluate this because whenever we handle toggle we could be adding the value to the

127
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,190
array or removing it from the array.

128
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:02,300
So if the current index is equal to minus 1 It means that it's not on the list because you're getting

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
a negative number.

130
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,460
It's not on the list.

131
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,440
So what we do.

132
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,830
We access this new checked that at the beginning of course it's an empty array but later if we have

133
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:18,470
a more checkboxes checked we will have some values and we're going to push the value to that list.

134
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,420
All right.

135
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,410
And if not we need to remove it because if it's a positive number it means that we already have that

136
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,460
value on the list.

137
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,780
So what we do we enter new checked and we do as plys.

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:36,020
Now with this place what you want me to do is to pass the position of the value we want to of course

139
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,330
delete and would index off if it's a positive number is the position of that.

140
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,500
So we passed the current index and then we say we want to remove one entry.

141
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,410
Just one entry.

142
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,020
If you put two or more is going to start on that index and it's going to delete the next two.

143
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,830
That's why we always need to put one.

144
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,560
If you want to delete one.

145
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,670
All right.

146
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,310
And then what we do we do this not set state open and close and we pass the new state of things because

147
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,060
we have new values.

148
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,980
All right.

149
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,780
So of course this is going to work.

150
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,630
But behind the scenes but you're not really going to see this if I click it.

151
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,510
Of course we are clicking this but nothing happens.

152
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,890
And it's because we are adding things to state.

153
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,020
But right here the check it's always false.

154
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:30,790
So we need to enter to the you know to the state that checked and check that we have that value.

155
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,710
And if we do set it to true.

156
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,400
Right.

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,910
OK.

158
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:41,800
This that state that checked dot and we can find the index off.

159
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,080
So if we do have the value I.D. We are using right here remember that we always pass the value and we

160
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:56,510
get this from the map if we can find this value inside the array of this that checked it means that

161
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,660
the value is true.

162
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,350
We that check box it's checked.

163
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,340
So this one will be true of course if you're not finding it is going to be false.

164
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,710
So what we're going to be doing is going to be going to say if it's not equal to minus one.

165
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,700
So if the element of course is not on the array this one will be true.

166
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,000
Right.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,840
I'm sorry it's on the rate it's going to be true.

168
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,210
If it's not on the array This one is going to be fault false.

169
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,880
So if I save this and go right here I'm going to do this and not really working.

170
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,660
Maybe I made a mistake.

171
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,520
That say that check in off the value I.D..

172
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,070
Let me just check what went wrong.

173
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,840
Maybe I did.

174
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,030
Oh of course.

175
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,520
This is not new.

176
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,580
You checked.

177
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,530
It's going to be checked.

178
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,150
They stayed right here the name it's checked it's not checked.

179
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,850
I'm just adding something to the state and I don't one that I want to say the check.

180
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,300
It's now equal to new checked.

181
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,390
All right.

182
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,150
Sorry for that.

183
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,860
So now if we check it it works and if I uncheck it it works one more time.

184
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,960
It's so like different values.

185
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,930
All right everything works or I mean.

186
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,860
So now we have a we have one more problem.

187
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,950
Whenever we are we are checking things right here.

188
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,180
We are of course again changing the state of this component.

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,540
The collapsable component the check box component but we are not really doing anything on the parent

190
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,440
component and that's why actually we need to go to make the net the network request and pass the filters

191
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,960
and everything else.

192
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,070
So if I do this console log device first inspect what we are getting.

193
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:48,540
So I'm going to say you checked me bring the inspect go to console.

194
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,420
If I click it we get one because his defender that is the offender.

195
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,480
If I do more we get an array with all the values that we are checking checking.

196
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,970
So what do we need do we need to grab this list and send it to read to the parent component.

197
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,950
And if you remember we have the handle filters for this right now.

198
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,970
Not doing anything.

199
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,370
But if we pass the filters we call the go to this problem.

200
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,450
We passed the filters as an argument.

201
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,760
This handle filters will be receiving the array of IDs and it knows that this is from a brand.

202
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,900
So we will need to do some logic right here to store it someplace.

203
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,890
All right let's do it right now.

204
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,290
I'm going to go right here.

205
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,850
I'm going to say that we need to go to this stock probs and you could do it right here.

206
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,850
Or you could do it on the callback of the state.

207
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,150
You have the ability to do that.

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,230
So this that prompts Dot and I believe we call it handle filters.

209
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:50,530
Let me copy to the mistakes and the filters and are going to be passing whatever I get from new checked.

210
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,310
Now instead of here we will get some arguments.

211
00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:03,510
You know the filtered arguments so I'm going to say filter's coma category and I'm going to do some

212
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,620
cons. look for the filters just to make sure we are getting everything correctly.

213
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,090
So let's try again.

214
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,480
And if I click it we get the rights Breguet.

215
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,150
So let me check if this went long now that we get we've got to go.

216
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:28,060
So now of course we could just copy the same code right here and do something else because we have more

217
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,700
checkboxes if we go.

218
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,590
And these closes if you go to the final we have Fretz we have once and everything else.

219
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,470
So then we just need to kind of manually do this.

220
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,110
So I'm going to copy this one they're going to go right here at the bottom.

221
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,240
So the second one it's going to be for four frets.

222
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,960
Right.

223
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,130
And actually we do not have frets right.

224
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,450
We don't have frets because they don't come from the server.

225
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,380
This one is coming from the server but Fretz we don't have a place on the server where we're going to

226
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,980
be hosting this so we can host it on a viable.

227
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,530
Right.

228
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,160
But first I'm going to I'm going to change the balance right here.

229
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,670
This one is going to be Fretz this one instead of products that brand are going to call it Fretz cinnamon

230
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,460
y and this one it's going to be Fretz.

231
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,200
OK.

232
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,920
So the initial state for this one and change it to false.

233
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,000
So from where we can get the frets.

234
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,500
Again I'm not going to do.

235
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,950
And we are now going to host something on the server where we can have just for values where we can

236
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:42,570
do can add a viable inside misc or someplace where we set the amount of Fretz.

237
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,000
Right.

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,890
Really simple.

239
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,480
So I'm going to call it fixed categories.

240
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,620
So I'm going to go to you Eutelsat and are going to add it to form because most of the times we will

241
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,440
be using this insight forum.

242
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:08,230
So your file fixed underscore category as the Jazz suffix categories is just an array of real values.

243
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,690
So I'm going to say Konst frets opening close an array of objects.

244
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,640
Now again just like we did before.

245
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,080
We need an ID and we need a name.

246
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,930
So underscore ID and why am I doing this because we're not really getting it from Mongo.

247
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,540
The thing is that on the clock checkbox we always make reference to show the checkboxes to underscore

248
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,990
ID so I need to respect the same keys if not of course not going to work.

249
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,300
So 20 coma and I going to be adding a name and 20.

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,920
Now this ones are to the amount of Fretz.

251
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:54,560
Now maybe if you're not really related to guitars but of 20 frets it's not very it's not very common.

252
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,540
You could have 21 frets on very old guitars.

253
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,220
I have a guitar from the 70s real expensive guitar.

254
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,360
You know it's a classic guitar and it has 21 frets but it's not very common.

255
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,910
Most of the time you're going to get 22 frets on you know modern guitars and you're going to get 24

256
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,430
guitars.

257
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,650
Most of my guitars they have 24.

258
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,790
I like the extra uptake on this but that's OK.

259
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,860
You know it's completely up to you.

260
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,980
So now we have the frets.

261
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,640
So now of course we need to import it at the top so we can make a reference to that viral so important

262
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:43,650
and we can bring Fretz and it's going to be from DOT DOT forward slash you tels for Slash form for Slash

263
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,070
and then fixed categories.

264
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,300
OK.

265
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,200
That is good.

266
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:54,150
So now since we have Fretz and we are making a reference to Fred if we go right here.

267
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,820
Let me just reload it.

268
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,030
We should be getting it.

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,020
I don't know what we are not getting it and I'm pretty sure I know why.

270
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,610
Maybe you know I'm not going to tell you.

271
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,090
Just think for one second why is my mistake.

272
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,630
Got it.

273
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,290
No.

274
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,500
I created a viral and and I'm not exporting it.

275
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,730
So I'm going to go at the top export Fretz.

276
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,160
All right.

277
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,120
So now should be working.

278
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,160
It's going to reload.

279
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,710
And if we go to France we get the amount of France that is get.

280
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:30,060
And this of course also work if I go round here and check the 20 on the console we get the arrays of

281
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,000
the you know whatever we are checking.

282
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,010
And same thing with the ID.

283
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,490
All right.

284
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,420
That is get.

285
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,880
So what else do we have.

286
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,860
We have woods and the woods.

287
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,510
We do have this from the server.

288
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,910
We get it from prop's inside redux.

289
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,220
So I'm going to go to the index.

290
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,990
I'm going to go right here at the bottom.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,820
Get a copy the one for brands and paste it right here.

292
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,640
OK.

293
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,240
So what's it's going to be called words.

294
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,040
Well and include what.

295
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,550
And then products and then what's something right here.

296
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,550
The filter called Get it called what.

297
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,450
All right.

298
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,310
If I save it

299
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:20,150
because as we get good and we get it from the server forget.

300
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,730
So now again we have a tiny it's not a problem.

301
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,450
It's actually how it works.

302
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,260
And I going to show you what we're going to be doing.

303
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:37,610
So if we check something we get you know the ID for an array for IDs from the from the brands that I

304
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,810
get if I go to Fretz we get a different.

305
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,510
We are not replacing replacing a rates.

306
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,190
This is a different rate.

307
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,770
The only difference is that this was this one is for Fretz.

308
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,780
If I go to once we get the ID for it the Basswood.

309
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,140
Now notice that on the brands I have to if I click one more we have three.

310
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,510
So you know there are different rates.

311
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:06,470
So when we make the request to the server we need a way to tell the server that we want to filter using

312
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,990
multiple things.

313
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,400
Right.

314
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,380
Because that's the idea.

315
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,620
We're going to go to the server and tell the server we want to do multiple What we want to return a

316
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,890
single operation a single array of objects but with multiple things OK.

317
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,450
So we need to pass to the server multiple instructions.

318
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,260
So I'm going to create a state and we're going to use more things right here in the state.

319
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,670
I'm going to do it right now.

320
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,830
I'm going to say grid.

321
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,640
I can do it like this.

322
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,100
That grid is going to be this we have at the top that initial state of this if it's empty.

323
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,690
Of course the default is this one.

324
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,630
But if we do have a value we're going to change it to that.

325
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:55,310
Are we're going to go back to that march much later then we're going to have a limit of six coma going

326
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,910
to have a skip of zero and we're going to go back to this later.

327
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,000
We are not going to do this right now.

328
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,300
Filter filters open.

329
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,510
And this is going to be an array of objects.

330
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,940
Now we have four different categories.

331
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:18,130
We have Rantz brand open and close an array of objects we have Fretz claw open an array of objects than

332
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,340
we have would open an array of objects and then we can have something called price.

333
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,130
Right.

334
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,540
And the prize again an array of objects.

335
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,890
So at the end when when we make when we go to that drought that we don't have we don't have that round.

336
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,010
We're going to be passing adjacent file.

337
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:42,500
You know Jason with the filters and from within the server on that route begin again.

338
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,770
Jason I'm going to say OK what do I get.

339
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,380
Do you have Brandt's for filtering.

340
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,470
Well yes you have two types of friends you have two IDs.

341
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,880
OK.

342
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:58,100
So when I go and go and find the data are going to search for only for this brands do we have Fretz

343
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,470
Yes.

344
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,720
OK.

345
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,300
So I'm going to search for Fretz as well.

346
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,750
Brandts and Fritz do we have would no is an empty array.

347
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,210
OK so I am not going to add what to the mix.

348
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,190
Do we have prices.

349
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,640
Yeah.

350
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,270
It's between zero and $1000.

351
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:18,250
OK so I'm going to search for all the brands with this values all the frets with this values and within

352
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,800
the range of price.

353
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,890
So that is it that which is going to be passing an array with an array of objects with instructions

354
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,470
that are on the server we going to filter and make the actual you know action.

355
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:36,350
But for now of course we need a way to send the values we get to the filters on the state and we are

356
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,520
going to do it on hantle filters now handle filters can do this.

357
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,880
We have a category that we're not going to really use right now because of all of the checkboxes are

358
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,720
the same.

359
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,150
The only one that is going to be a little bit weird it's the radio that we're going to do this on the

360
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,060
next section.

361
00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:00,680
So on the handle on the Hendel filters we're going to do Konst new filters and it's going to be equal

362
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,540
to dot dot dot.

363
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,440
There's that state that filters.

364
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,120
So we're just making a copy of filters so we don't mutated.

365
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,500
So I'm going to enter new filters.

366
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm going to open it going to be passing the category.

367
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:16,760
Right.

368
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,320
The category we get right here.

369
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:26,390
That's that's how we are able to go to the state and purchase values on a particular category then we're

370
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,920
going to use it for a different thing.

371
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,000
But for now it's good.

372
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,360
So I'm going to say OK so we're going to go inside that category and we're going to put inside whatever

373
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,250
we get back on filters.

374
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,890
You know that array of objects.

375
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,290
All right.

376
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,890
And then of course what are we going to be doing.

377
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:53,020
Is did this data set state opening close and then filter filters equals to whatever we have inside New

378
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,340
filters.

379
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,130
All right now I'm going to do console log.

380
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,790
There's that state and I'm going to go RIGHT HERE.

381
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:13,920
Now if I click on Fender now we have filters on brand we have LMB do this better.

382
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,180
Is this that state that filters just like this.

383
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:25,340
It's a little bit better of course when the application loads we have nothing any fight click.

384
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,970
We have brands and we have one.

385
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,820
Maybe then we're going to select I want to see all the Basswood guitars.

386
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:39,220
So we have two categories to search the brands and by what same thing would Fretz well.

387
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,810
Okay.

388
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:48,130
So this works of course we need to do a lot more a lot more after we said the state of filters begin

389
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,680
to run a different function to make the actual request to you know this Patchi action.

390
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,200
But we are not there yet.

391
00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:03,100
First we need to do the price with the radio boxes the the radio and this is a new reusable component

392
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,470
just like checkboxes.

393
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
So we need to do a lot of things right here.

394
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,970
So let's go to the next section and do the radio.

395
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,530
We still need to do a lot of things but we are almost almost done on done.

1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,080
All right so now we are going to create the links on the header and this is going to be a challenge

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,460
because they are a little bit weird.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,090
Why.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,520
OK.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,900
Let me show you the final one.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,510
Let me go to home now right here.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,020
We have some links and this ones are kind of public.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,260
So whether you're love then or not you should be getting this option and then you have a different part

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,830
to the letter which is the user options.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,470
And and this one if you are locked out you mean.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,380
I mean you're not locked in.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,100
You should be getting log in.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,340
Now if you logon just like I'm going to do right now.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,070
Passport.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,240
One two three.

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,560
I'm going to log in.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,090
You sure can.

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,970
You'd be getting some other options.

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,840
And the public option.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,360
Well now some of these options are links.

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,770
Most of them are links but the log out for example.

22
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,290
It's not a link.

23
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,860
We are not going to create a route just to log out.

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,060
So this one is it's a device that triggers a function.

25
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,090
So we need again to remove this.

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,610
All right.

27
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,370
So let's you know let's begin with this.

28
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,170
So first before we go right here I want to output the name last name and e-mail right here.

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,840
Now remember that if we go to a user an index we are just displaying some information now right here.

30
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,950
When after we did we did the out of all the components all the children of that you know then that composed

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,820
component are receiving new props.

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,250
In this case we could say prompts that user.

33
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,250
But I'm going to just bring the user.

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:40,370
So now instead of here what I can do I can make corrections to that user that user data just like this

35
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,770
user data is a data and bring just a name.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,440
So if I reload the application of course when you log in.

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,270
So Francis and then password 1 2 3 get to log in we get Frances.

38
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,840
So instantly we easily get all the information above the user that it's luck and once we are inside

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,160
this route and this is happening right here and it's happening at home for example if the users log

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,240
then we should be getting the user information and we should be able to perform some of the actions

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,590
like we will in a future like adding things to the user account.

42
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,160
All right.

43
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,390
So let me complete this.

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,050
We need the username we need to use a last name and then the e-mail.

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,370
So last name and then e-mail.

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,060
And if you remember again inside of this user user data we have again the prompts for the history so

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,120
we can begin to catch a history of the user.

48
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,940
OK so now let's go to the head.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,550
I'm going to go to the letter like it's all before this is going to be a little bit weird.

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,920
So right so right here we have the logo at the top.

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,110
We have some blanks which is the user links and at the bottom we have the public links.

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,860
Now we don't have any any of this links to see yet.

53
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,510
So like with that before you're going to create.

54
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,170
Right here on the tablet we go right here you're going to read some kind of a bbls or maybe a state

55
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,460
or whatever where we can host the links and they're going to do it through state not state opening close.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,540
Now we have the links at the bottom and the links at the top.

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,200
So I'm going to host them on a different place.

58
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,340
So Page is going to be the Public Links and then we can have the user links.

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,990
So I'm going to say user and we can have more links.

60
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,590
All right.

61
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,790
So inside of here it's a link.

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
We'll it will have some properties.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,380
First the name of what is the name of the link in this case home.

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,980
Where are we going to be going to.

65
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,550
So link to and this one will be home.

66
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,690
And then we have a different option which is going to be is this a public link or a private link that

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,840
users should be getting this should be getting this link.

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,700
Even they are locked out.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,420
Well there's going to be adding in the public.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,410
And if it's a public link it's going to be true.

71
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,550
That of course we're going to do all we're going to do all this logic in a coma.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,250
All right the next one after home we have guitars which is the sharp guitar section.

73
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,690
All right.

74
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,840
And that one of course is public.

75
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,020
So.

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,620
I'm going to say guitars and then shop are going to name this shop.

77
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,820
Of course we need to remember this when we created the real route.

78
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,090
Then we have the user.

79
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,130
All right.

80
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,940
So going to copy and paste now on the user it will get an option that calls my cart.

81
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,250
So I'm going to say my card with a capital C and this one will go to user.

82
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,590
If you remember for Slash and then cart.

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,180
And again this Natas this route.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,190
It's not public.

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,590
If the user is logged out we should be able to get this right what else we have my account.

86
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,490
So my count.

87
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,000
So we're going to get this my account and whenever we click it we're going to go to the user dashboard.

88
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,340
So dashboard and this one is false.

89
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,670
It's not public.

90
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,610
All right.

91
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,650
Get a copy again and paste into the next one.

92
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,590
And now right here at the top we get the log in.

93
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,700
But if the user is locked out begin to open.

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,570
Oh sorry we are going to get the log in.

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:32,090
And if by log in Francis at gmail dot com password 2:59 that log in goes out and we get the log out.

96
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,190
Right.

97
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:33,970
All right.

98
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:42,580
So this one it's going to be log in log an I'm sorry.

99
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,960
And whenever we do the log in we're going to go to register underscore log in.

100
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,890
And now this one should be true because we can get the log in option whenever the user it's not locked.

101
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,510
And but this one is on the user options.

102
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,800
So this one will be pulled the chair and the next one which just log out.

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,770
It's pretty much the same thing.

104
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,380
Logout and then user for Slash log out.

105
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,850
And this one will be public false.

106
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,510
All right.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,600
So now we have all the options.

108
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,370
So of course we need to catch.

109
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,810
We need to do something right here maybe create a function or do something else so we can go.

110
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,840
And of course render whatever we want.

111
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,350
So now I'm going to read a couple of functions.

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,230
But before we do that the thing is before we do that we need to check we need to access some place in

113
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,760
our application so we can check if the user is locked and or the user is locked out.

114
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,030
You know if it's out indicated and the problem is right now that we get that information inside the

115
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,810
route but we are doing better on the layout so we can not access that prompts that we are doing with

116
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,630
the mouth.

117
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,890
So what we will need to do is we will need to check with redux need to access this that prompts the

118
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,440
user.

119
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,320
So we need to bring redux to the equation.

120
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,690
Right.

121
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,060
So I'm going to go at the top and first begin to import link because we don't need links so import link

122
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,720
from Rio re-act router Tom Raigad.

123
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:24,970
Now I'm going to go right here and say import and we need to import connect from UPS connect from and

124
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,480
re-act redux.

125
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,000
All right.

126
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,790
Now of course we need to go at the bottom and you know connect to redux.

127
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:42,860
So export default then connect open and close and then open the header and close it just like this.

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,890
Now we need to bring map state to prop's because we need to inject the user prompts know the prompt

129
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,690
we get from back from redux.

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,900
So we can use it right here inside of the render.

131
00:07:52,930 --> 00:08:05,940
So just like with that before function map state two props open and close we get a state and we say

132
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,560
return open enclosed user and we get back whatever we have inside the state that user.

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,830
All right.

134
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,620
Very good.

135
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,430
So now of course we pass the maps state to Propst so we can inject the props right here right.

136
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,090
Now now we have two different types of links the page and the user.

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,180
So right here first I got to say this dot show links.

138
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,280
We don't have this function we can agree to right now.

139
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,330
Capitol show links.

140
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,200
And whenever we want to show the links at the bottom I'm just going to pass that does that state that

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,520
page which are the blanks at the bottom.

142
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,690
And whenever we want to render this section the links at the top we're going to say I want to render

143
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,800
the users.

144
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,560
So now this function will be receiving the items we want to display on each part of the you know the

145
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,090
right section of the header.

146
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,880
Right.

147
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,450
So I'm going to go at the top.

148
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,270
Let me just make this.

149
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,810
OK.

150
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,880
So I'm going to go right here and create this function that we didn't have so far.

151
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,430
And that's why we get an error on the page which it says show links and I get a call.

152
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm going to pass it as time because it's type of page or type user.

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,340
This one should be user.

154
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,830
All right user right.

155
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,430
Very good.

156
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,140
So now we're going to get this time.

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,770
Now the thing is again on this section right here at the top we need some of some of them are public.

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,850
Some of them are you know links some of them are something else.

159
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,000
So we need to do some checking and do something else.

160
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:47,540
Now the first problem that we get is that some of the links are only going to show if we are authenticated.

161
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,860
So we kind of need to do some checking.

162
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,410
And what I'm going to do instead of just rendering whatever we have inside of here I'm going to make

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,560
a new list right here a new array.

164
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,360
I'm going to make some checking.

165
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,910
Of course we're going to look them we're going to do some checking.

166
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,910
And if the elements should be on the list I'm going to put it on you list.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,090
And at the end will render this list that we can't get right here instead of this one.

168
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,470
All right.

169
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,120
So first we're going to create a new viral called List equals to an empty array.

170
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,240
All right.

171
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,400
Then of course what we need to do we need to check if the user it's logged in.

172
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:31,360
Since we are using redux we have already injecting the props we use or so this prompts the user and

173
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,710
I get to make sure that we have that user data property.

174
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,710
Now remember that if we go to a route and if we are not authenticated let's assume that we are not authenticated

175
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,400
and we go to home that our file our file that elth logic is still going on.

176
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,710
So we will always get some something with user data whether user data or maybe saying that the user

177
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,390
is not indicated or something like that.

178
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,110
So we will always get it even though we are authenticated or not.

179
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,870
OK.

180
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,970
So if we do have this this we're going to do something now.

181
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,360
What we're going to do I'm going to enter the type which is where we have all this links and I'm going

182
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,200
to do a for each for each just like this.

183
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,810
OK.

184
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,170
Now for each We're going to do something.

185
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,020
And what I want to do I went to pass an item on each iteration.

186
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,020
Now first we want to check if the user or south indicated or not.

187
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,420
So I'm going to say if open and close and if not we're going to do something else.

188
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,470
So if the user is not open to it begin to do something.

189
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:45,460
So if this that prompts that user that user data and remember that we have that is off property.

190
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,460
So if the user it's not o'th indicated we're going to do something in this case we want to check if

191
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,950
the item is public because we have some of the options are public and some other are not really public.

192
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,100
So when you get to do or are going to check if they are public because they need to be public so public

193
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,860
equals true we could get this because we've already have billions but that's OK.

194
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm going to enter to that list and I going push this item item.

195
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,140
OK so what we are doing we are entering this list and since the user is not out indicated we are creating

196
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,650
a new list with only of the items with the public.

197
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,070
True only.

198
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,300
So for example if you're locked out this one is false.

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,860
This one would not be on the list.

200
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,720
This one will not be on the list.

201
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,390
This is the one.

202
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,030
Yes.

203
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,710
Because we are not logged in so we should be getting the option to log in.

204
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,220
And this one will not be on the list.

205
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,380
So that is the meaning of doing this.

206
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,560
OK.

207
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,800
What happens if the users log in.

208
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,630
OK so I'm going to go right here I'm going to say f and create one more check.

209
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:59,050
Now for example if the user is not blocked then we shouldn't show this option to the user because they

210
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,150
are already logged then.

211
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,160
But we need to use it to show the log out.

212
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,450
All right.

213
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:14,010
So I'm going to say if item that name it's different then log in and we need to use the same keywords

214
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,560
and copy just to be safe.

215
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,990
Log in we're going to push that item.

216
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,530
So list that push and then item.

217
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,450
So now all the items that we have right here that are public falls we're going to push that to the list

218
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,110
unless we have the log in.

219
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,730
This one will not be on the list.

220
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,620
So if these are lost is logged then we're going to get my card my account and log out.

221
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,000
That is the idea.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,760
All right.

223
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,800
So then at the end of course the end of doing all this nonsense.

224
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,690
We need to return something.

225
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,210
Right.

226
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,060
We are just doing the checking right here.

227
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,380
But at the end we are not returning anything.

228
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,150
So nothing gets displayed on the screen.

229
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,050
So I'm going to return and what we will be returning.

230
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,150
It's a loop.

231
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,850
I'm going to answer to that list.

232
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,510
I'm going to map over it.

233
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm going to return an item and iteration.

234
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,840
All right.

235
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,210
And then of course we return something so what will you be returning.

236
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,920
In this case I'm going to tell you why in a minute we're going to return a new function return.

237
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:30,790
And I'm going to say this dot and default like opening close item that I later we're going to have other

238
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,050
options like the cart like Deckard takes a different layout.

239
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,990
So for this one we need to have a render a different components or we need to pass more arguments and

240
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,630
make the changes on this function.

241
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,820
But the default link is just a link with with it you know just a link from Briac rotor to property and

242
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,510
the text that's set.

243
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,640
That's why I'm creating this.

244
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,040
Just a default link.

245
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,430
So of course we're going to return this default link and this one will be returning to link.

246
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,060
All right.

247
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,540
So let's create a default link option.

248
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,400
Going to go right here.

249
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,370
Default link equals to item II and at the end this one will be returning some GSX.

250
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,730
So for now I'm just going to say look we can extend this in a minute.

251
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,660
But for now I'm going to say Lenk.

252
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,000
So the link if you remember we get it to an inside of the item of this function.

253
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,460
We have the item that link to.

254
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,280
All right.

255
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,810
Then we have a key because we are looping something so key opening close and I can get past the iteration

256
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,540
iteration.

257
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:42,390
And then of course we have the contents of the link which is going to be item that name.

258
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,030
All right.

259
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,840
And that is that.

260
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,820
Let's see what happens.

261
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,380
Items it's not defined.

262
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,840
Let me find the mistake.

263
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,640
Item the item its list pushed item.

264
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,110
There we go.

265
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,080
Sorry for that.

266
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,690
Let's try again to get it right.

267
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,940
You know we can get it because we are not Blug.

268
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:10,560
So we get the non public true options home guitars and log in.

269
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:18,280
Now if I log in we're going to go to Francis Jamail then password 2:59 are going to log in.

270
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,880
Are we going to get it get my card my account log out home and guitars and just like it's all before

271
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,020
we need to extend this because the my card it's going to be different.

272
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,650
This is a link but with something else on top and the logout.

273
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,150
It's not really a link.

274
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,660
It's going to be just a function.

275
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,160
So we kind of need to create something else maybe a div with an unclick or something like that because

276
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,710
by default the linked property of re-act router needs to.

277
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,350
All right.

278
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,980
So this one went too long already.

279
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,980
Let's go to the next one and finish this.

280
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,240
It's going to be to resemble.

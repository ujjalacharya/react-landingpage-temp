1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,470
Good.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:01,820
OK.

3
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,440
So let's create a component that it's going to be receiving the props for the buy sell and the arrival

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,970
and it's going to loop them and show each card.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,760
All right.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,890
So I'm going to create this inside you tells so inside details.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,240
I'm going to create a component called Card block.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,000
You'll have two types of card blocks.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,190
This one will just print or four or maybe a little bit more if you have you know a sing line but they

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,440
will be all all rendered in a single line single straight line.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,230
The other one is going to do a different thing which you know right here we get this kind of a lay out.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,950
So they are kind of two different things.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,230
They look pretty much similar pretty similar but they're different.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:52,870
So inside the card block right here we need to create just up a component right to react statelets components.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,020
So there's one tool called Card block card block.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,070
OK.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,440
And this one will be receiving props because we get it from the server and we pass it to this component.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:14,540
So on the return and I'm going to mix them spacebar here I can create a container class name of card

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,350
block.

20
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,790
Now each side of the card block we will have a container.

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:26,330
So Dave called class name of container just like this.

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,930
All right.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,490
Everything is going to be center right in the in the middle.

24
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,220
Now I'm going to do this before hand on each card section.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,130
Let me go to home.

26
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,860
We will get a title and then you know the elements.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,870
Now what happens if I want to use this component but with a different title.

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,230
We are doing right here.

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,870
So right here we have new arrivals.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,980
And the best on the guitar so I can not just do H-1 and hard code that.

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,290
So when I'm going to do.

32
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,620
We're going to be passing the props by title.

33
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,280
So I got to X props.

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm going to check if we do have a title I'm doing this because we might not have a title.

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,790
Maybe we don't need a title.

36
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,160
So we have the ability of not passing the title so that props and then I'm going to add a class name

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,950
and there's one title and this one will be renderer rendering whatever we have inside props.

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,740
And then that title.

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,390
Now the actual container that contain that contains the going good style right here inline style an

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,680
opening close.

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:39,720
And this one will be a display that is play and that Sprague is going to be flex and are going to app

42
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,500
flex wrap just like this and then wrap.

43
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,970
All right.

44
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,740
There you go.

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,470
So now I'm going to create a function that it's going to be looping the cartes render cards.

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,580
And remember that we only can only render one card inside a component.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,830
We just need to create a component with a single card.

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,460
So this one is the one in charge of looping of this.

49
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,070
So again it's a process that list and begin to be passing the list of cards inside the list property

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,960
we're going to do it in a minute now.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,550
OK.

52
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:26,580
So this one will be called Konst and the function name it's rent or cartes equal to open and close.

53
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,400
So this one will need to check if we do have a list.

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,210
Now if we do have a list we do something.

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,240
If not we do we don't do anything.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,150
Now I'm going to enter props.

57
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm going to enter list and I get a map and whenever we map we need a card which is what we get a card.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,460
And then each ration number Y card block.

59
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,900
No card.

60
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,650
Then of course we need to return some GSX.

61
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,120
So I'm going to do this and I made a mistake right here says we are going to return J sacks.

62
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,580
I need to do the parenthesis.

63
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,740
All right.

64
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,140
OK.

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,360
So now what do we need to do.

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,210
We just need to return something for now.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm just going to say card in a string.

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,900
Just going to render a string maybe a div with a string because at the end we will have a div or a div

69
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,500
with the word card.

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
Doesn't matter.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
OK.

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,620
So in the end when we rendered this component we should be getting two cards to keywords cards right

73
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,170
here.

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,940
OK.

75
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,590
So let's go home.

76
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,540
So now let's import this component from this.

77
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,890
Let's pass the props and see what happens.

78
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,370
So import import.

79
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,450
And it's going to be called Card block from the dot for Slash utils for Slash.

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,210
And then a card block.

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,040
Now I'm going to go below the home slider and then make reference to the card block and we open and

82
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,810
close.

83
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,470
Now if you remember we need to pass a list and a title so list with equals.

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:11,210
And if you remember again we are using redux So we are injecting props and begin to be passing this

85
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,460
props Dodd products because we are storing everything inside products and then we have the buy sell

86
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,110
property.

87
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:34,870
All right then I'm going to say title title equals and the title and I believe best selling guitars.

88
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,340
All right so the application will reload.

89
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,580
And what we get we get the best selling guitars and we get four different card renders.

90
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,960
All right.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,860
So that's good.

92
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,410
This is actually working.

93
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,390
And I've got to create a new one for the whole promotion and just do it right now.

94
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,380
So the only thing left will be creating the actual card that it's going to go inside card block.

95
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:05,340
And this one it's by the arrival OK and new arrivals you arrivals right.

96
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,330
OK.

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,790
Let's see what you get and.

98
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,590
Oh and of course I'm storing this.

99
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,580
And of course it's restarting this notion is restarting the server and we are trying to fetch something

100
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,380
before the server gets restart.

101
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:30,100
So if you get just like this frozen like this just reload the page because the server you know it's

102
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,920
already up and running.

103
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,550
OK so now we need to create the cart.

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,700
Right.

105
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,260
All right.

106
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,070
So let's go to you tell us one more time.

107
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,060
And inside your tears your tools are going to create a new file called cart.

108
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,940
All right.

109
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,380
So the card component it's going to be pretty pretty much simple.

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,950
But later we're going to extend this a little bit more.

111
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,460
And I'm going to use a class based component so create a react class based component.

112
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,290
All right I'm going to call this car with a capital C right.

113
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,280
OK.

114
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,380
So what do we need to do here.

115
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,580
First when we are going to get some props around here this card will only be rendering of course went

116
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,240
with props the props or be are passing from the card blog that we're going to make a reference right

117
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,880
here.

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,930
So we're going to be passing props.

119
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,450
OK.

120
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,970
So whenever we get the props we just need to show with the template the template with the props we have

121
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,480
inside.

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,570
Really simple.

123
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,480
So I'm going to import from the card block the card.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,210
I believe the gold cart cart not carts from that for Slash and then just cart.

125
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,460
All right.

126
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,580
So OK.

127
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,110
Let's make a reference to this card.

128
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,210
Open and close.

129
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,470
So again we are looping something right here.

130
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:03,560
So I'm going to remove the div and just pass the card and I'm going to give the key a key to these actual

131
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,100
component.

132
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,640
So going to say key and you make it right.

133
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,960
Keep off.

134
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,740
And I pass the iteration and the other thing we need is whatever we get back from carts.

135
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,900
Now if I do a card like this and then pass whatever I have inside card inside of the card component

136
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,000
I will need to do this.

137
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:32,750
Probst up card the card and you know it's not right so I'm going to do something else.

138
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,430
I'm going to do that dad and then cart.

139
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,690
All right so now with all the promise that we all the kids devalues everything else we get from card.

140
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,220
We're going to inject this to the cart.

141
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,810
So now it's out of here.

142
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,260
We just need to make a reference to this doc Probst and the whatever name we have inside of their movie

143
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,500
The images or the name or the brand or whatever.

144
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,580
All right.

145
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,480
That's good.

146
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,090
So let's go right here inside and start creating the template first.

147
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:08,790
I don't want to make a reference to props to this that props every time I'm going to say this props

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,770
and now I'm going to make a reference just props.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,340
So the class name for this is going to be class name and I'm going to do the following.

150
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,710
Now later much later and I'm going to show you this right now.

151
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,910
We're going to get this at the top.

152
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:32,560
We're going to show the elements by this type of cart or by this type of cart ride.

153
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,640
So we need to change classes the only thing I'm doing right here is change the name of a couple of classes.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,010
So we will get whenever we pass a cart we will pass a property of you know style type of style.

155
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,420
You're not doing it right here at home because we don't need it but we can use it much later.

156
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,480
So instead of giving a class name with just quotes are going to use templates strings and then anything

157
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,870
to attach or detach classes.

158
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:04,440
So this one is going to be cart item and then wrapper then it's paste and we're going to get this from

159
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,060
props.

160
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:14,340
So if we do get something that says props that grew red we can you know display the other type of layout.

161
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,050
But right now we are not going to do it.

162
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm just going to leave it ready for the future.

163
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,780
Whenever we create this of course whenever we go we create this component this behavior we can go back

164
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,750
to here.

165
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,300
OK.

166
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,800
So the first thing we need to render is the image.

167
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,060
So Def opening close.

168
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,010
I going to add a class name to dip a class name of image.

169
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,930
Very simple.

170
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,580
And then we need to pass the style because the background image.

171
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,370
So style open and close.

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,620
We need to pass the background.

173
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,860
So back ground.

174
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,520
All right.

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:58,060
So opening closer a template string parenthesis and then I'm going to make a reference to.

176
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,040
And what are we going to be using.

177
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,860
Let me comment this now.

178
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,280
What are we going to be using.

179
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:17,010
So if I go back to home and I check I state open and close by cell and we get 38 and a c we don't really

180
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,270
have images so we have an empty array of images.

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,180
What are we going to be displaying.

182
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,460
So in theory we should be getting at least one image.

183
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,470
If we end whenever we enter a product later we get do it.

184
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,170
We should be getting at least one image but right now we could happen that we get nothing.

185
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,720
Maybe the image of the product is not ready yet.

186
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,950
We don't even have the product maybe.

187
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,800
So you know again the attachment of image whenever we create products it's not required.

188
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,800
So we need to create a way to detect if we have empty images.

189
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,650
You know if we don't have an image and maybe show a different one.

190
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,270
All right.

191
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:02,730
So instead instead of background I will say this dot render card image which is I'm just going to call

192
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,470
to a function and I'm going to pass probs dot images.

193
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,320
So what going to happen of course is that we have an empty array.

194
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,630
Later much later we will attach images.

195
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,360
But for now we're going to do this function so we can catch that.

196
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,380
We have no images and maybe show a different image or none available image.

197
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,510
So we have no repeat and that is good.

198
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,300
So I'm going to create the render card image function we are using a class we can do this.

199
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,610
So right here we will be getting images.

200
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,420
We know that this is an empty array.

201
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,350
So I'm going to create a NF and an else.

202
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:52,370
So if images dot length it's greater than zero it means that we do have an image.

203
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,870
So I'm going to access that array with the same return.

204
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm going to access the images and I'm going to pass the first image and then I remember that we have

205
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,400
a new or else I'm going to be passing the R L.

206
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:10,620
Now of course we didn't have that scenario right now but later when we enter images inside of the aerial

207
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,960
images we'll have of course objects and inside of object we have the title of the image or maybe the

208
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,930
you are an L or something like that.

209
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,780
So we can call it by you r l we need to remember this but we are not there yet.

210
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,870
OK return.

211
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,580
And since we don't have an image I want to return whatever is inside images and we have an image not

212
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:40,420
available image not available and then that PNB pinchy just like this.

213
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,820
If I go to images we have the image not available right here.

214
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,630
All right.

215
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,210
Very good.

216
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,850
So are we getting something so far.

217
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,070
Maybe not.

218
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,030
Not yet.

219
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,700
OK.

220
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,870
So OK.

221
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,360
So now I'm going to go right here at the bottom and say Dave and I are going to go to create a class

222
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,630
name off.

223
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,430
I'm going to call it action underscore container.

224
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,400
Me move it around.

225
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,270
All right.

226
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,380
Oh sorry it's not inside the actual image.

227
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,670
It's outside of the image container.

228
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,200
So let me move this

229
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:20,850
so.

230
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,080
So now what we need to do.

231
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,390
We need to feel this.

232
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,160
We have pretty much all the information about the product.

233
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:32,400
So you know the brands the type the name and you know that model name.

234
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,260
So inside the actual container and it created one more container.

235
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,600
And this one will be getting the class name of tax because they are pretty much tax.

236
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,100
So they're open and close we're going to make it on one line.

237
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,670
So the class name for this one it's brand.

238
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm using different class name because maybe later we can do something special.

239
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm not sure yet.

240
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:03,140
So this prompts the brand that and we get the name we remember that the brands are inside an object

241
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,750
then we have the name.

242
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,350
So I'm going to say name prop's that name.

243
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,670
What else.

244
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,520
We have the price so we get price.

245
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,180
And of course we can attach the dollar sign or currency sign or whatever.

246
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,580
OK.

247
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,600
So we get something we are not getting the images.

248
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,410
I don't know why.

249
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,030
We're going to check it in a minute.

250
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,360
So but for now it's get what else we have a description right.

251
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,910
We have a description of this one but we might not have a description on this one we didn't have it

252
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,170
but we could attach it.

253
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,110
Now if I go to the grid mode we do have a description and that of course comes from the server.

254
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,720
So I'm going to do it right now.

255
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,390
I'm going to go right here after the action conductor after the tax.

256
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:59,260
I'm going to open something and say OK if prop's dot grid opening close we're going to return something.

257
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,640
If not begin to return.

258
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,290
No.

259
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,340
Right.

260
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,270
So I'm going to create a class name.

261
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,670
I don't know Dave.

262
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,690
Yeah.

263
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,810
And the class name of the scription.

264
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:19,450
And this of course is going to be whatever we get into this later much much later then we need to do

265
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,540
more.

266
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,850
We have the actions right.

267
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,500
OK.

268
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,950
And this one is going to be a little bit longer because the actions the buttons that we get are really

269
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,400
different than the other ones we get.

270
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,290
You know this one has a different style.

271
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,020
We even get it.

272
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,380
Hoover.

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,050
Hoover effect.

274
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,760
And it was just when it's bigger so they have different DSS.

275
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,800
And on this one we just have a Nikon So again instead of using the default link we need to create two

276
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,570
different links because they are of course different.

277
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,210
So this one went a little long.

278
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,410
Yeah a bit long.

279
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,800
So let's go to the next one.

280
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,310
And keep doing this.

281
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,560
Meanwhile I'm going to check why we are not getting the image.

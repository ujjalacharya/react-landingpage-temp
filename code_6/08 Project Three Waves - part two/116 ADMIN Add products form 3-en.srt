1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,560
So what we need to do now is to add the textarea and the selects and I get to go off course to form

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,560
fields and we need to do it right here.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,550
And I'm going to do both right now the text area and they select because of course we're going to use

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,960
them right now.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,880
So first I'm going to create a case of text and then area opening close and never forget to do the break.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,730
So of course we pretty much need the same thing so I'm going to copy the form take the form template

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,730
and paste it right here.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,950
So the show label stays the same.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,620
Then of course when it's going change it's going to be the input to delete everything inside of here.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,430
I will do text area and then of course it could be a self-closing tag.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,450
And then just like with did before right here we need to pass the form data and config.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,740
We do have a value and we do have a number and a change.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,480
So I'm going to copy and paste and that is it you know really really simple.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,450
I just got to love your reusable components.

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,610
We don't need to do anything else.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,060
Yeah.

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,060
Let's get.

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,700
So now we need the select when it's going to be a little bit different in the case right here at the

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,090
top.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:17,840
So if we have a case of select on we do it correctly select opening close and never forget the break

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,950
never if not of course nothing is going to really work.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,400
Maybe the impact is going to work but not now and if anything else is just not going to work I'm sorry

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,480
the text area because it's the last break.

24
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,260
OK.

25
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,300
So instead of here we just do pretty much the same thing right now just going to copy the form template

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,810
and I'm going to paste.

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,540
Of course we need to change something.

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,220
So we still have the form block and we still have the label right.

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,490
So I'm going to delete the text area.

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,760
So what we need right here is to select a right opening close with the select just like we do have with

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,980
the beginning at the top.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,370
We still have value on Bloor and a change and we don't get to form data to fit into form data config.

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,410
We don't use that on the Select because we don't need to inject everything inside of the tag.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,120
All right what we do get it's options.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,460
So the first option is going to be select and an empty value.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,860
And right here you could choose to do whatever you want.

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,330
Maybe select the disabled value or something like that.

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,830
Or maybe a default one.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,140
So the first leg is going to be a value of nothing.

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,330
Then of course we need to loop the options that begin to be getting from the server or from the array

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,290
with keys and values.

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,540
So we enter to form data and I'm going to close this so we can see all that and get a do config DOD

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:48,050
options dart map and I'm doing this a little bit faster because we did this a few times already.

44
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,440
So I'm going to open and of course we need to return some GSX so parenthesis then of course we have

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,340
option opening close.

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,560
We have a key now.

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,260
So it's key of item dot.

48
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,870
And remember we are using a key and that's key.

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,150
It's not the key is the key of the of the loop.

50
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,530
Right.

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,630
Remember we have an object right here we key in value.

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,050
So then of course we have the value I'm going to drop this.

53
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,640
So it's a little bit more organized.

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,190
So value and the value is equal to the same item and the send key.

55
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,160
All right.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,200
And that of course inside of here instead of the option we just have the value right.

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,540
OK.

58
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,800
So item that value and that is it.

59
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,160
We don't need anything else.

60
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,080
Hopefully I didn't make any mistakes.

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:49,460
So we're going to go back to our product and now we can start adding the rest of the form fields.

62
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,960
So the first one was the name the second one was the description and that is the text area.

63
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:01,070
So I'm going to go here and say description can to copy and paste it.

64
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,080
Let's see what we get.

65
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,840
And we get product description and you know it is a text area.

66
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,930
Of course you can change this to whatever you want.

67
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,840
Now I'm just going to leave it the next one is going to be the price.

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:22,670
So copy paste and price price and then price.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,100
Do we get it.

70
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,880
Yeah we get it.

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
We were getting an error message because we didn't have the added form so far.

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,120
And it is a type of number.

73
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,800
Very good.

74
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,120
So I'm going to go back here and say that I want a ruler.

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,530
Now the thing is that the ruler looked a little bit weird for me.

76
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,320
D'Harmental ruler so I'm going to add a class name of a form divider just like this.

77
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,950
Now I just realized that I have a couple of stakes you need to fix them right now of course.

78
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,120
If not the application will fail.

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,290
So the next ones are pretty much all selects right.

80
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,760
We need the Bran's the shipping the available and everything else.

81
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,110
So I'm going to copy one of the top just maybe the first one doesn't matter.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,780
They're all the same.

83
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,740
And then we need to add the brand and then the brand.

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,360
All right.

85
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,220
They're all the same.

86
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,210
Again just like with it before you could create just a function to render all at once you can do that.

87
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,180
Yeah no problem.

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,250
So rant and brand now of course we get this.

89
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,550
And this is actually my mistake if we go back to the form fields and we go right here.

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,790
It's not option it's options.

91
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,710
And then it's not option Upton.

92
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,990
It's option.

93
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,150
Sorry.

94
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,330
All right let's try again.

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,730
So Adelies we get to get no armis of course the information is empty.

96
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,100
And he of course tried to do something.

97
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,300
Nothing really happens.

98
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,680
And we my getting we might be getting an error message but that is OK.

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,290
OK.

100
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,540
So I'm going to go to back to our products and the next one are the shipping and the available.

101
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,690
So going to copy paste.

102
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm going to say shipping and I'm going to say shipping the next one.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,010
It's available.

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,350
So go right here available and then available.

105
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,250
Right.

106
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:17,480
I will add a new form divider horn when Varner point form divider.

107
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,060
Then I'm going to copy the brand.

108
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,460
And now we need the words.

109
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:26,070
So for the word is just what similar to what I believe on the avi.

110
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,790
But you know pretty much it's really really close.

111
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,180
So I'm going to go to after.

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,700
We have Fretz.

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,280
And remember that the word we will get the data from the server.

114
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,890
So that's the next thing we're going to do.

115
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,290
So after Fretz are going to copy a new form divider are going to go right here at the bottom and we

116
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,930
need to put the publish notice tell if the product it's public or not.

117
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,930
So we're going to say publish right now at the bottom.

118
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,960
And this was the last one.

119
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,010
We need to enter it when you get the button and the forms access messages and everything else.

120
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,650
So I'm going to go to register and I'm going to copy them from here.

121
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,070
So we're going to paste them when I get them trying to make this a little bit nicer.

122
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Kind of a failing but that's OK.

123
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:24,740
So instead of creating an account we will have product the form error stays the same but now we have

124
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,960
form success.

125
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,340
So I'm going to copy the I'm going to put a the big curly braces.

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:38,760
There's the state that forms success and of course if we don't get a success we will not do anything.

127
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,830
And of course of course name and then form success.

128
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:52,140
And of course if we are getting a success we just displayed success you could do whatever you want right

129
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,590
here.

130
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,220
Now remember that after we post the product to the database we will get the product back.

131
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,540
We could do that.

132
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,660
So when we get that we will get it back we can store it in a magical place inside redux.

133
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,730
And then of course access through prompts.

134
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,110
And once you access through prompts you get the idea of the article you just entered.

135
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,840
Right.

136
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,550
And you put the ID or the link to the article right there.

137
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,890
And that is it.

138
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,110
OK.

139
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,480
So everything looks nice.

140
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,070
If I save it of course we got we can it get it.

141
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,860
All right.

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,210
So the next thing will be populating the brands.

143
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,380
And for this we need to do a fat should the server to get the brands and the words and we need to create

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:45,140
a function that takes this values and it will go inside brands ride and enter the fields out pneumatically

145
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,810
can update the fields.

146
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,920
Let's do that right now.

147
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,390
All right so where are we going to be fetching the brands and the woods.

148
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,280
So from the component about right.

149
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,920
All right.

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,970
So a component that MT open opening close.

151
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:10,870
So first I'm going to do a get a copy of the form form data just like this because whenever we reach

152
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,410
to the component amount I'll just copy whatever we have in the state right now whenever it enters here.

153
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,510
So State Farm data you could just pass this state the form data layer.

154
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,870
You could do that.

155
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,550
So OK.

156
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:31,600
So first we need to dispatch to get the Prince so this that prompts that this patch just like this.

157
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,520
And we say get brands.

158
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:45,100
All right of course then something happens when we get a response which is you know do something now

159
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,630
we're going to do something of course.

160
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,290
But first I want to check went to make sure that we get the prance.

161
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,150
So I'm going to just console log this that prompts.

162
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:03,680
Remember we are inside products products products dot and then Brant's.

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,980
Ryan Okay let's see what we get.

164
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,350
I'm not using the readouts right here.

165
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,040
Just going to go to the Gudel console so we get an array of nine.

166
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,420
We are getting the brands.

167
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,980
So now what we need to do is to this can convert everything go to the state and store it on the right

168
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,200
place because this is going to go chest in brands.

169
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,130
So I'm going to delete and copy this one because I'm going to use it in a minute and I'm lazy.

170
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,970
So Konst form data.

171
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:44,130
New form data new form data equals and we will create a function that calls populate option.

173
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:53,320
Or it could be options yes but played option and then fields all right and this function will take a

174
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,250
few arguments it's going to take that form data we have at the top.

175
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,530
So I'm going to say form data and this form data is viable.

176
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,870
And then again we're going to pass this that props that product the Brandts that contains all the brands

177
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,650
and then we get past the idea of where we going to be hosting this insight form data.

178
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,650
What is the key.

179
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:20,730
In this case is just brand remember it's just a single not Brandt's just brand run to sprint.

180
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,500
All right.

181
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,790
So after we process all of this this new form data will contain the new state with the brand and all

182
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,160
the options inside.

183
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,420
So after we do this we just need to update the fields.

184
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,040
But for now we are just going to leave it like here.

185
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,490
We're going to get we're going to check in a minute what we get from new form data so we need to create

186
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,040
this populate option fields.

187
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:49,960
We don't have this and we will do this in side form actions are going to go to form actions cobby Popul

188
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,030
late let me make it ride populate.

189
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,340
There we go.

190
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm going to go to form actions remember we have it inside your tills and we're going to add the function

191
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,850
just here.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Export Konst populate Opt-In fields.

193
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,170
We will get some Arkes and then we will do something or I'm okay.

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,180
So this public option feels will receive that form data that coma.

195
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,560
We will get an array of data which at the beginning could be just empty if we don't get it.

196
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,500
Just in case.

197
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,420
And then you know the field the field where are going to be modifying this saga.

198
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:39,020
So first I'm going to create a new array Konst array or it could be in your array and it's going to

199
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,500
be equal to nothing.

200
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,010
Ryan then I'm going to grab that new form data.

201
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,590
You form data I'm going to create a new form data sorry just like this and this new form data is going

202
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:57,710
to be equal to whatever we have inside form data that is going to happen in this case right.

203
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,770
We could just use the form data we get back here.

204
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,700
All right.

205
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,210
So what do we need to do is very simple which just push the values inside the key inside the new form

206
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,850
data.

207
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,790
So OK so I'm going to go right here and I call I'm going to call this array data and I'm going to grab

208
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,850
that array data that we get going to do dot and I'm going to do a for each on the top.

209
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,280
So for each value we have and the array of data which is all the the Brandt's we were getting right

210
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:36,330
here we're going to loop them and in each iteration we will convert and attach them to the new array.

211
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,870
Ryan kind of makes sense.

212
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,370
So we're going to enter the new array.

213
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,890
I'm going to push a new value.

214
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,540
But the new value in this time is going to be an object with a key and a value.

215
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,860
We are just converting this with we can A did this previously.

216
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:59,070
So the key is going to be the item item dot underscore ID.

217
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,600
All right.

218
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,020
Then we put a coma and going to pass the value and the value is the item that dot and the name.

219
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,450
And this is what comes from the server.

220
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,070
If you remember whenever we get the.

221
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,820
And then go back to our product.

222
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:19,990
Whenever we get the new form that new form data I'm sorry the the this that props the products and brands.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,090
Let me just show you again because maybe you don't remember console that log.

224
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,690
This prompts that product the brand.

225
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,890
It's a long string.

226
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:37,820
We get nine and we get the ID underscore ID and this one has a name it's not you know maybe value or

227
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,920
something like that.

228
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,060
That's why on the form actions we are making a reference to item that name.

229
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,800
So we are just pushing the object pretty much the same information on a different way.

230
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,730
So all right.

231
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,660
So we have the new foreign data the copy we made right here at the top.

232
00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:01,850
I want to enter the key and the key is inside field and then I'm going to say that I'm going to enter

233
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,790
the config dot.

234
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,710
I'm going to enter the options.

235
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,230
I'm going to say that the new array is now the new value of that one.

236
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,770
Now of course this function needs to return something.

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,540
So we can return new form data right.

238
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,230
And that is it.

239
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,040
Now populate option fields.

240
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:30,530
If you go back to our product and I do the new form data we're going to get that new you know the new

241
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:41,080
array so we get it let's go to Brant's and we go to config and then inside options we have key and value

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,000
right.

243
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:48,490
So the only thing left right now is to update update the state but we can run a function that actually

244
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,380
does this and it's going to be called update fields.

245
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,050
Right.

246
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,020
All right let's try to do it right now.

247
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,590
So I got to create a function that calls update fields.

248
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:08,150
So this dot update fields opening close and begin to be passing this new form data.

249
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,820
All right.

250
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,520
So let's create the function right now.

251
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:18,100
You're going to say update fields equals to something and after something we will get you know just

252
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,580
an argument right here.

253
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,470
So the object fields is going to be really really easy.

254
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,700
We just set the state.

255
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,890
The thing is that I'm making a function of this because we can do several dispatches maybe to make later

256
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,840
we can do more.

257
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
And you know creating a does that said state.

258
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,570
And then this that said state and then again kind of makes no sense.

259
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,240
So right inside of that feels the only thing we do right now is this.

260
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,910
That said state of form data equals whatever we get.

261
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,120
Right here is an argument.

262
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,200
New form data data.

263
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,820
All right.

264
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,650
That is that we should be getting this

265
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,270
when we go to France and we get.

266
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,110
That's right.

267
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:14,220
And of course it fails because we don't have the update form whenever we do it and change that is OK.

268
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,770
OK so let's do the brand and then just move onto the next section so we can complete this.

269
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:27,550
Now this one pretty much the same instead of get Brandt's we have the other dispatch we just get words

270
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,190
on the function.

271
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,820
So get what's published feels pretty much the same.

272
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,170
But on this one it's what if I save it and not notice again.

273
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,590
Sometimes it's always good to take the you know take a look a little bit more and instead of doing everything

274
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,030
here just create a different function to do this.

275
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,620
And it just closes on the way.

276
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,810
All right.

277
00:17:51,850 --> 00:18:00,190
So we have the brands that is get Let's go to the wood and see if I can find a word with material of

278
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,690
course material.

279
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:14,470
And I get an incorrect of course get words when we just change this race Pond's response DNA changed

280
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
us to of course.

281
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,900
Is this a practice that would What's sorry for that.

282
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,040
So let's see if this works best.

283
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,380
Good mahogany in our right.

284
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,080
My favorite is either if you're wondering OK so everything looks good.

285
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,370
All the selects are pretty much none.

286
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,910
Of course if we select something we get the update form.

287
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,180
Now everything went too long so let's go to the next one and complete the form.

288
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,560
Right.

289
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,550
And we will try to post everything to the server.

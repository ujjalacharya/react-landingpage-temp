1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,010
OK so let's continue this.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,070
Whenever we get this we pass a set of instructions we're going to get an error and we're going to get

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,960
the actual articles right.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,580
OK.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:20,790
If we do get an error we're going to return return a response of status opening close of 400 because

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,760
we get an error and going to send error.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,980
Of course if everything goes OK we're going to rent We're going to rest.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,990
And the response of status opening close of 200 which means that everything goes OK.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,690
And the response is going to be a Jason and instead of the Jason if you remember the reducer it's expecting

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,140
an article and a size.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,090
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to say OK.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,220
So the size of this it's equal to articles Dot and I going to get that length of this.

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,190
And again we will get back to this later.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,090
We will need it.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,450
The only thing we do is to tell the send the response and tell how many articles are actually returning.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,740
If it's a 6 or it's less.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,560
And right now it could you a tip.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,350
So articles are going to say articles articles is going to be equal to articles.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,630
Right.

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,030
We are just sending the articles.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,690
Right.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,410
So now the producer will be getting this response.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,250
So we should be getting something at least from the server on an unload.

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,970
So I'm going to go right here to the state and we go to products and we have to shop with the first

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,280
six articles.

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,070
Right.

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,680
And then we have the two shop size which is equal to sex Burgman.

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,750
So we are kind of getting this right.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,600
Of course we just get the first six on the database.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,120
All right.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,160
And it's by default again it's descending.

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,820
So it's bringing the first the new ones.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,440
All right.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,060
So now what happens if we apply a filter.

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm going to go to this and we don't have that logic so far.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,590
So when this is going to happen and I'm going to delete the console log right here because it's bothering.

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,420
OK.

38
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,820
So of course we need to trigger this whenever we make change on the filters.

39
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,730
So they handle filters will be a place to you know trigger this idea.

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,240
All right.

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:23,490
So whenever we make a change to filters and of course we set the filters are going to do does not show

42
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:32,160
filter red or something like that results and are going to be passing the new set of filters because

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,340
at this point whenever we make a change we have new filters inside of the state.

44
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,250
Right.

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,510
So when it copy the name of the function and I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going

46
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,850
to say that this one is just a function opening close.

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,750
And of course.

48
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,600
All right.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,510
So the only thing we need to do here is to dispatch the same action we have right here but with different

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,240
data ride with different state because now the state of philtres is going to be different.

51
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,610
So pretty much we just need to trigger the same action.

52
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,650
So I'm going to copy this because I want to type it again and I'm going to go right here now.

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,710
We need to change a few things because whenever we filter something it means that are starting again

54
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,530
from scratch maybe the user clicked the offender.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,220
Right.

56
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,230
And so the server goes and Frank brings all the articles with Fender and maybe they have I don't know

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,500
200 articles with Fender.

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,090
Right.

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,720
And then OK when they say I want to get fender and I have a..

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,290
So the server needs to start from scratch.

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,750
It cannot skip any values because we need to bring again from the zero the first six from the zero of

62
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,520
the pen there.

63
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,170
And Ivan its results.

64
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,100
So we need to reset the skip back to zero.

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,670
It's going to start from the scratch.

66
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,830
The limit is going to be the same and the filters are going to be whatever filters we are passing right

67
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,420
here.

68
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,300
So we're going to pass this as an argument filters and that this that state that filters not anymore

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,960
is going to be filters.

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,670
All right.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,930
We'll be sorry.

72
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,630
And then of course since we are resetting skip maybe maybe later again maybe the user had its cause

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,540
has to skip off.

74
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,250
I don't know.

75
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,130
Twenty.

76
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,790
So after we dispatched this we are kind of resetting that state.

77
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,260
So we're going to do.

78
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,470
Then and only then after we of course we get the new articles we are going to graph this state this

79
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,760
that said state opening close and we're going to set that cap back to zero.

80
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,870
So in theory sorry we should be getting something are going to save it.

82
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,420
I'm going to reload it.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,670
And of course we are getting inside of the state the articles right.

84
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,280
Usually the default articles.

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,790
Now I'm going to click on fender and we're going to check the state again.

86
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,980
So right here we have something else.

87
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,760
It says that the shape size now it's two.

88
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,440
So the server is just ringing.

89
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,090
It's just bringing two different results.

90
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,840
Right.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,150
So I go to shop and we removed all of this and now the state it's something else.

92
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,430
Right.

93
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,920
It's something different.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,870
It's difficult to state.

95
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,140
We have to shop and we get two articles.

96
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,510
And this one's our funder of course we don't see that.

97
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,940
We see the the the idea of the brand.

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,910
Right here we have a DVD out there we got we get fender and the next one of course is going to be fender

99
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,660
as well so brand fender.

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,580
All right.

101
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,510
What happens if we select buy wood.

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,280
I know that this would for example it's Basswood.

103
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,150
Let me check the other one.

104
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,590
The other one the other wood it's mass whatso.

105
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:47,880
Yeah.

106
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,650
Well it's not going to work.

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,440
This one has 22 frets this went 22.

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,820
OK just let me try to find something unique on this one.

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,520
This one is the price of 600.

110
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,210
And the other one is the price of let me find it.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,550
The price of one.

112
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,400
All right.

113
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,060
So what we can do we can go to Price and try to filter that.

114
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,940
So if I do tune only to zero from zero to 99 we're going to get one result right.

115
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,990
That's the logic.

116
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,350
So we get one we solved on the difference and if I go here we get only one result.

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,280
So from the server we're getting that correct response a price point we get only one result.

118
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,940
So from the server again we are getting the correct response.

119
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,730
So the filters are really working.

120
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,170
Now the next thing is going to be catching this results.

121
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,820
We get from redux and this playing the cards right here.

122
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,930
And later we're going to go back of course to all this logic on the reducers and everything else to

123
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,350
create the load more because of the load more we're going to need to use that cap and that limit so

124
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,290
we need to modify some bad news and do some a little bit of logic.

125
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,250
It's not going to be really hard to get.

126
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,670
Let's go to the next section and start with the carts right here.

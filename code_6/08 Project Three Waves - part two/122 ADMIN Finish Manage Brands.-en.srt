1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,440
OK so let's finish this.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,910
We need to include to get Brandt's.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,540
So remember the product actions we created the brands sorry the rants.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,300
And one quick change I did success with 1c should be with two C's So now we need to go to the submit

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,720
form and instead of doing the Council look we need to dispatch the action right.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,470
So we're going to go here on the bottom and say this not Probst that dispatch open and close and we

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,920
pass this brand.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,960
If you remember this brand as a first argument it will take the data to submit and then the previous

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:46,410
you know the current state of all the brands and I'm going to store this inside of your existing brands

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,930
maybe with a capital P system Brandt's and this one is equal to whatever we get we get inside this stuff

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,880
prop's the products that Brandt's.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:05,790
So this Prawle props props that products that brands right.

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,740
So instead of passing this string we just pass it like this.

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,530
All right.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,810
Then of course the promise gets resolved.

16
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,380
So we will get a response and then we just do something.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,920
Now we are now going to do something very special right here we're just going to listen for the success

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,630
of the payload.

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,470
We are not going to do the this that problem even though you could you could listen for that Probst

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,210
and then go to our brand to see if you get a success.

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,220
And then of course take action.

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:44,030
And but if we do that we will need to clear due clear brand then to change the brand to nothing.

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,080
So I'm going to take the simple road here the easy road.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:59,700
So I'm going to go and say response that payload that success remember that from the action we get the

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,050
success so we can catch it from there.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,870
If everything went okay then of course we want to do something.

27
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:14,130
So what we'll do we will reset reset fields and then hndler we don't have this function we can add

28
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,970
it right now of course if something goes wrong we're going to say this.

29
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:26,500
That said state and begin it add to form error to true for error.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,080
Burguet so we don't have this function again to create it.

31
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,910
So we set fields handler open and closed and then we do something.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,230
If you go to add product we can have this field and are we going to already get it right there.

33
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,900
So I'm going to copy the first lines right here.

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,030
The first one and the second one and we don't need to time out because we are not doing a form success

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,090
and we are not dispatching anything to clear the product in real life if you're not using the payload

36
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,030
as a validation of you know to check if everything went okay you should do the dispatch and that clear

37
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,040
just a heads up.

38
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,910
Okay.

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,050
So right here we get that we said form Hanafi of fuel handler and Brandt's and that is okay.

40
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,070
So everything should work.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
We did it a little bit fast.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,110
Everything was really fast.

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,690
So let's try it should be working and let's try it.

44
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,120
Okay.

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,950
So I'm going to add I don't know Buddha or whatever not that a real name but doesn't matter a real name

46
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,130
for guitars of these.

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,960
So going at it ok it clears and we go to Buda.

48
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,540
All right.

49
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,610
So again this was really simple.

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,640
We could you know add an hour to scroll then go to the bottom and show you know successfully added.

51
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,490
But again we kind of already did this.

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,710
There's no need to do this.

53
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:51,780
I'm just adding because I'm trying to get the project as complete as we can get and without a managed

54
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,970
category's know no ability to enter France.

55
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,560
Well it's not a real sick and we can get.

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060
But of course we are saving a lot of time.

57
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,470
We spend like I don't know.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Creating the third project what 12 hours.

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
Ten hours.

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,330
So in real life you're not going to create a real application a real web site with all of this in 10

61
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,320
hours not going to happen is going to take like a month or month and a half maybe more depending.

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,910
Depends on the project.

63
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:30,220
But again I'm just trying to save time so we can do other things things that are a little bit more challenging

64
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,640
like the cart and everything else.

65
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,840
So now we're going to do the Brant's are going to posit BDO have a glass of water and we're going into

66
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,250
the woods sorry and this one is just pretty much the same the same than here.

67
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,800
But the requests are going to go to what's right.

68
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,230
So I'm going to take five and then we can finish what's write so let's do the words real quick.

69
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,360
So I'm going to go to manage what's going to put it just here.

70
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,930
So we need to import a lot of things and most of the things are going to be the same.

71
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,750
You're going to realize right now they're going to copy the fields are going to copy the connect and

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,460
I'm going to paste it right here.

73
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,060
All right.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,180
So now we don't get get France we get what's so what's and delete the ad BRAMs then we're going to at

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,470
the at what.

76
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:27,350
Of course now instead of here I got to go to manage brands and copy the state because it's the same

77
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,150
exact state pasted so element input name impled still in it.

78
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,480
The same could be would it but that's OK with you.

79
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,310
So enter the word.

80
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,960
Everything else is just the same.

81
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,330
All right what else we need to copy the content you know the layout.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,890
So I'm going to go to manage France I'm going to copy pretty much the whole thing right here.

83
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,190
Just going to copy and paste it.

84
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,800
All right.

85
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:04,160
So even though even in class the container the name of the containers are the same because when I was

86
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,080
building this the final one they put in the previous one.

87
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,810
What I did before I was going to do something else with what's pretty much the same actions to enter

88
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,210
to a list and everything else.

89
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,290
But it was going to be a different layout and then I stopped for five minutes and say OK this is not

90
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,600
really that important.

91
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,190
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time.

92
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:25,800
OK.

93
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,090
So Kateri items everything else is the same.

94
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,340
The form field is the same.

95
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,490
Everything just here stays the same.

96
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,130
All right.

97
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,210
So I'm going to go to manage France and go at the top what else.

98
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,430
It's just the same.

99
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,200
Well then we need to show contemporary items.

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,090
So I'm going to copy and paste right here now instead of doing brands we are doing worse.

101
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,070
So whenever we get the props it's going to be what's right.

102
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,670
OK.

103
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,730
Then we loop Woods and what we do we return the same thing.

104
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,980
Now to get the props first we need to connect this to of course to redux.

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,780
So I'm going to go with what I'm going to copy the maps the props pretty much the same and then connect

106
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,730
again pretty much the same and manage what's in it copy and say manage what's an almost done.

107
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,350
All right.

108
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,370
So I'm going to go back to mench France.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,030
What else is going to be the same.

110
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,930
So we have the shark attack where we did this and the update form it's pretty much always the same so

111
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,690
I'm going to copy this and I'm going to paste it right here at the bottom and instead of France now

112
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,290
it's going to be words.

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,790
Either way we make a mistake right here.

114
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,770
Nothing is going to really happen.

115
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:48,370
Of course if we reload we get it but we don't get lists of France it's because we need to do the component

116
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,660
dismount to fetch the list of ports.

117
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,280
So add the component about and instead of get Brandt's it's get worse.

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,040
All right.

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,090
Let's see if we get it.

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,550
OK.

121
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:08,460
So we get it of course we need to change the title to what's around.

122
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,610
So enter word.

123
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,000
Of course the name of the button.

124
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,620
So at word.

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,680
OK.

126
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,090
So then of course we need to submit the form.

127
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,060
Right.

128
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,490
All right.

129
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,770
So we're going to go to manage France and copy they submit form.

130
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,450
This one is going to change a little bit.

131
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,130
So I'm going to I'm going to copy and then paste it.

132
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,280
All right.

133
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,170
So instead of France we will use words.

134
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,920
Now the existing words and we will be getting the props the products that Woods.

135
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,130
Right.

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,440
And for now I'm just going to do this because we need to create dispatch.

137
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:47,750
Right.

138
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,820
We don't have that we don't have that action.

139
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,430
OK.

140
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,780
But everything else just looks nice.

141
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,280
Of course we need to add that dispatch this create the action.

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,750
So we get to go to product action.

143
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,630
And I believe we can call it at what's right.

144
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,310
Right here we have a brand.

145
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,890
So we need to add words and Singler of course.

146
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,670
So at in that word.

147
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,490
OK.

148
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,440
COMO of course we need to add it to types.

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:30,980
You know the usual stuff export and it Konst word and word right now if you push me up if you push me

150
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,440
in just a little bit I could have created a component just to render this reusable component.

151
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,460
That's OK.

152
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,570
All right.

153
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:46,070
So we're going to go back to productions and I'm going to go right here at the bottom we have the two

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,050
categories we have the brand.

155
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,860
Make it a little bit nicer.

156
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,500
All right.

157
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,730
So the brand and the woods they will be actually they're going to do the same thing.

158
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:05,550
I'm going to copy paste now instead of brand is going to be what the existing Brandt's is going to be

159
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,820
existing good.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,590
Right.

161
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,450
The products server.

162
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,580
Now we can add would know the other one was brand singler.

163
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,840
This one is what.

164
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,870
OK.

165
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,070
So on the response we will that will be getting worse instead of exists brand is going to be existing

166
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,710
what you can do this on your own if you want to try it at home alone.

167
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,870
That's OK.

168
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:36,890
So then woods and woods and instead of at Brant you had that would the rigor add.

169
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,670
What.

170
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,260
All right.

171
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,980
And then of course we send the request.

172
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,930
Now we need to go to the douceur.

173
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,240
And of course change all of this right.

174
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:53,320
And existing existing words sorry for this should be plural existing words and existing ones.

175
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,050
Okay.

176
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,500
So now let's go to the products reducer and first we need to add to copy the type.

177
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,490
So that would product reducer and then go right here.

178
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,310
I know changing tabs and everything is a little bit confusing but in real life this is how it goes.

179
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,940
It could be changing tabs every time.

180
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:22,670
So I'm going to copy the brand and do the ad would sell it type ad would right here at the bottom what.

181
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,260
And then we have the state.

182
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:37,450
This one is going to be wood and instead of brands if we can have of course what's so what's And that

183
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,090
is it.

184
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,750
OK.

185
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,460
So words would everything looks correct.

186
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
So it should be working.

187
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,560
We did a lot of pacing so we might be getting in our.

188
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,860
But that's OK.

189
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,590
It should be working.

190
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,430
So let's give it a try.

191
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,940
So before we get to trial of course we need to dispatch an action so the action was called.

192
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,890
If you remember I don't remember have a bad memory.

193
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,610
So add what.

194
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,630
So I'm going to copy and paste.

195
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,190
All right.

196
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,610
We're going to go to the submit form and of course we need to dispatch in action and right here just

197
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,450
like we did before.

198
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:25,480
We just need to pass the second argument of what's so this not prompts that dispatch opening close and

199
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:32,230
we passed this at what this one will be taking the data to submit coma and the second argument is the

200
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:39,190
existing one so we can merge everything later than we get it then we get a response and everything else

201
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
is just the same.

202
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,470
So if I open and close and I'm going to copy the other one products actually Nope manage rants.

203
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,920
There it is that we pretty much have the same code.

204
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,860
We don't need to change anything else.

205
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,790
So I'm going to copy paste it.

206
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,190
And that is it.

207
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,630
All right.

208
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:58,870
OK.

209
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,570
So let's try to check if everything is OK so we can get this out of the way and we can go to the site

210
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,170
info.

211
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,960
That's what is going to be a little bit different.

212
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,340
So I don't know.

213
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,020
Hard would I believe that it would.

214
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,930
So add word and OK something fails it's because something fails right here and that what maybe we are

215
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,130
not returning words from the server.

216
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,670
Oh let's check it out.

217
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:33,200
At brand word you're getting word or ride.

218
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,030
So notice that on the word we are changing this to true right.

219
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,290
And the words we are not getting anything.

220
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,500
So let me just double check why and I'm pretty sure I know why but I'm going to check it without you

221
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,620
right here.

222
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,780
No.

223
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,670
Actually we were able to add this to the server.

224
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,520
So when everybody reloaded the page of course we are getting because it's going to the server.

225
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,700
The problem is the reducer that it's not injecting the prompts.

226
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,330
All right.

227
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,510
And if I go to the producer again.

228
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,760
Well it's actually that payloads.

229
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,930
And this is the problem from the server you're getting what.

230
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,420
So that that one should be would.

231
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,130
Right.

232
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:11,700
OK.

233
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,940
What.

234
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,370
OK.

235
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:22,080
So actually it's woods if we go to products the actions we are returning what's all right.

236
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,540
Let's try it again.

237
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,350
And I don't know any other I don't know.

238
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,240
Let me just think about one.

239
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,620
Oh I have one.

240
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,150
Ebony.

241
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,910
Ebony.

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,870
It's a very common not very common but we could use it.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,880
So I can add it and we got it.

244
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,090
All right man.

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,110
So we are finished with this.

246
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,960
OK so everything is ready right here.

247
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,800
Of course sip everything so you can get it if you didn't do this and it can go to site info.

248
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:59,350
So on site info what we can be doing is just adding the side information it could be called managed

249
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,210
site or something like that.

250
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,140
And later much later we're going to add more things.

251
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,850
But for now we're just going to add this.

252
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,630
And for this we need to create a new model where we're going to be storing everything else.

253
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,700
So it's like a site in vord site data inside the server inside mongoose.

254
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:17,950
All right.

255
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,130
So I'm going to skip everything and let's go to the next one and do the site info and then we're going

256
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,290
to do something a little bit more interesting.

257
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,970
We're just going to be the guitars whenever we go to New Product.

258
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,770
We get to be product and of course we have the we have this.

259
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,500
So this is a little bit more fun than the other one.

260
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,790
All right.

261
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,260
So let's go to the next one.

1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,890
So let's do the buns.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,440
And I know what we are not why we are not getting the image and it's because the name is strong and

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,290
by here the name it's wrong as well you know the name the real name of image.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,860
I'm going to copy and I'm going to paste that real name.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,030
All right.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,930
So if we reload we get sorry image not available.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,880
Maybe you're wondering why I make mistakes and it's because well it makes sense.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm talking I'm coding at the same time and I'm watching the final code right here so I could have a

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,030
performing three tasks at the same time.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,410
And not only that when I when I watched the final code I need to decide what comes first.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,570
So you can understand it.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,650
And one what comes last.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,630
So yeah again you can add up a human.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,110
My wife it's actual neuroscientist.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,940
So the brain cannot process three things at the same time could do only one.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,560
That's that's how it is.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,960
But what we do we multitask we change from here to here to here.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,640
And that process of course wears you out.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,750
And that's why I'm making mistakes so I have to apologize for that.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,140
OK.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,160
But again talking writing and watching all the things not that easy.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,240
All right.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,060
So OK.

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,330
Let's I'm going to save this.

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,910
Now we get the image so we need to create the buttons.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,490
Now we have two types of buttons right here.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,860
We have the new product and this one.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,690
So what I want to do I want to create inside buttons because we need to go to button.

29
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,510
We need to create a new type of button.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,930
Now for this one for this button the only thing that changes from default is just to class we changed

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,450
a class name so I'm going to make this a little bit better.

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,030
I'm going to back to I'm going to go back to cartes right.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,240
Going to go back to cards and I am going to change.

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,380
I'm going to make a request.

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm going to I'm sorry I'm going to include the acoustic component my button and it's distilled default

36
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,770
but I will add a new property called alternative class.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,700
So if we do have this alternative class we will switch classes.

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,530
All right let's do it first.

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,200
I got to say my Birnam Let's first create the wrap for this because we need a wrapper right here.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,720
So I'm going to add the class name off and it's going to be called actions.

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,190
And he said if you're going to rub the button inside something called class name and then.

42
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:27,840
And.

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,420
And then.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,460
OK.

45
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,360
So you sort of here of course we will get the button right.

46
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,570
So I make a reference to my button opening close.

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,610
I know we are included at the top.

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,470
That's good.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,940
So again this one needs props.

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,620
So the type again it's default.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,230
So I'm going to say default.

52
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,170
I'm going to add this of turn out of class.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,540
So class alternative class and it's Card link.

54
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,950
All right.

55
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:08,430
Next we have a title so title equals and this one will be bew with a capital B and product.

56
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,050
Next we have a link.

57
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,280
So it's link capital T and two equals two.

58
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,480
And we pass the location of this product.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,090
Now if you remember from the database let me go here from the database.

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:31,740
Each card has has an ID and this is how are we going to be accessing this product later on it's own

61
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,870
section.

62
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,520
OK.

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:44,400
So I'm going to call the section product detail for Slash and then we attach this props that underscore

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,410
ID.

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,400
OK.

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,860
Then we go and we need to add some stylings and I'm going to do the same then before I can add styles

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,120
and styles equal to opening close.

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,340
And I will add this and margin the same thing we did before 10 pixels zero zero zero.

69
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,010
All right.

70
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,270
So right now if we go we get to fold one right.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,770
So we need to make the logic right here for this alternative class.

72
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,840
So I'm going to go to button and right here we're going to say OK if we do have an alternate class we're

73
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,510
going to show it.

74
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,130
It's not going to show the default.

75
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,560
We just need to do a turnaround.

76
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,480
Very simple.

77
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,800
So I'm going to delete this.

78
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,610
I get all of this out.

79
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm going to open and close.

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:43,240
So if props that alternative class is not defined then we want to return the class alternative.

81
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,190
Like I'm sorry.

82
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,420
Link default.

83
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,590
If not we're going to put whatever we get back from alternative class since it's going to be the other

84
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,480
one we get the product right now we get pretty much to 100 percent because this is flex and we need

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,080
to add the odds of the other.

86
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,340
But in we don't have a case for this it's going to be a new case.

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,450
That's OK let's create it first.

88
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:13,820
So on the other one the first burn rap going to go outside that and create a new element with the same

89
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,330
class name but in rap because they are flex.

90
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,580
So now this one is a little bit special because it's not a link it's a function.

91
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,100
Whenever I click on this I went to trigger a function and that function much much later is going to

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,880
go to the dispatch begin to dispatch an action so we can add the card I can add that element ID to the

93
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,400
card of the user right.

94
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,180
And of course if we don't have the user it's not really luck then we're going to do of course something

95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,740
else we're going to show an alert or Right now we are going to do just to console.

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,470
OK.

97
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,720
So we're going to go here and say my button open and close.

98
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,710
Now this one we get a call this one type of.

99
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:04,520
And I called this back like open close and then I'm going to save run action.

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,320
So this run action is just a callback function.

101
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,650
Whenever we trigger we're going to trigger this callback function.

102
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,840
Right now we're going to say Konst log to cart something like that something simple or added to card.

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,150
That's good.

104
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,350
And now we need to go to button and add this back link case.

105
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,760
So inside of here we're going to go below here and say OK if we get back Lenk we want to do something

106
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,780
and never forget to do the break.

107
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,670
All right.

108
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,590
So tackling gets risible.

109
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,720
It's just a button with an unclick.

110
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,960
So we do Templi do the template.

111
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,390
It's equal to.

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,350
And I'm going to do going to do it here.

113
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:57,270
It's equal to just a div with a class name of back link and I'm going to attach right here the on.

114
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,670
I'm going to say unclick it's equal to a function.

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,260
And whenever we want to run this function we run the prop's Dot run action that we are passing right

116
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,620
here as a prop for that run action.

117
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,230
This of course this run action will be triggered by this and right here we then we going to do that

118
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,830
dispatch.

119
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,310
But for now we are called bigot.

120
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,860
Now this one has an icon.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,000
This shopping bag and we are not including any icons at the top.

122
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,730
So I'm going to go over here on the top and in say import font then.

123
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,900
Awesome awesome.

124
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,920
And then icon then from.

125
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,670
And it's going to be at Fonte awesome.

126
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,640
And it was the last one yeah.

127
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,210
The free solid read that is get oh sorry.

128
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,600
No it's not the free it's fun it's awesome.

129
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,090
And then react.

130
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,820
Awesome.

131
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,460
The other one is to freeze solid.

132
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,930
Now of course we are bringing in front of on Thompson I come and then we need to import the icon and

133
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,890
that's that is the one that it's solid.

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:19,670
So this one calls it a shopping and then back from at 0 at Sorry we'll do it again at an font.

135
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,290
Awesome.

136
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,070
And I believe it was the last one found and this one is for.

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,530
Awesome.

138
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,240
No fun.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,730
Awesome.

140
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,700
Let's do it go again.

141
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,720
Awesome.

142
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,210
And it was the last one for you saw it.

143
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,960
All right.

144
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,550
For slash F.A. shopping bag.

145
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,940
And that is it.

146
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,990
We have the icon right now so I'm going to copy the name of the icon.

147
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm going to go here and we're going to make a reference to this font.

148
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,400
Awesome icon.

149
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,330
And paste it right.

150
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,900
So now we need to pass the name of the icon.

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,860
Pretty standard stuff this.

152
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,420
And it was called a shopping bag.

153
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,960
Hopefully they're not there are no mistakes.

154
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,680
So if can he get it.

155
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,200
All right.

156
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,230
There you go.

157
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,390
So let's see what we get.

158
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,560
Couldn't find font awesome reaction.

159
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:13,860
Awesome.

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm pretty sure I made a mistake with this.

161
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,380
So let's go back.

162
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,260
It's a font.

163
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,180
Awesome.

164
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,430
Actually Well we are getting this a lot of this.

165
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,150
Oh I just realized this.

166
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,800
It's just very hard for.

167
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,170
Awesome.

168
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,940
Why awesome in that font.

169
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,850
Awesome.

170
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,490
And this is actually coming from the Noj modules and it's actually weird.

171
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,040
Never realized this.

172
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,430
So if I do four awesome

173
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,320
we get it.

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,210
Hurrah.

175
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,950
It's really weird.

176
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,530
OK.

177
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,190
Well maybe they are not the official font awesome kind of a get have dependency all over or whatever

178
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,240
you want to call it.

179
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,980
So maybe that's why they are using a different name or something like that.

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,070
It's weird.

181
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,300
I don't know why.

182
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:09,060
Maybe it's because they are the one to use a different keyboard so they don't use the same keywords

183
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,030
and all the ones.

184
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,100
So that's why they do this.

185
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,130
But that's the way it works.

186
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,960
Why now.

187
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,630
OK.

188
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,500
So we get the icon.

189
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:26,760
And if I click it and I go to the inspect we get the console lock out at two cards.

190
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,530
All right.

191
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,150
So that is good of course.

192
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,170
Now what we need to do.

193
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:39,200
We need to do some other stuff because whenever we click right here we didn't have an action to dispatch.

194
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,760
Right.

195
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,450
So we wanted to create an action to add this item to the to the user card and what it's more more important

196
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,600
is that we didn't have a request to handle this right.

197
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,490
We didn't have a request to do this on the server.

198
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,230
Whenever we make a request we need a place where we can catch the idea of the product.

199
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,280
The idea of the user and go to the server go to the actual model get the product and stored inside of

200
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,770
the you know the history of the user.

201
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,140
Actually it's not history.

202
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,770
It's the cart we need to grab the element.

203
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,290
The idea of the product get it go to the user and store it inside of it.

204
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,910
A theory of cart since of course we are using all of this will of course reload the props and it will

205
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,380
inject right here at the top and we'll see a number and everything else.

206
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,430
So we need to do all of that we can do it.

207
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,520
We're going to do it later.

208
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:40,530
We are not going to do it right now we can go back to this when we have a more complete website because

209
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:47,220
the whole card logic and then the log in and inside the user we can see the we can actually make the

210
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,850
purchase.

211
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,750
It's going to be pretty complicated.

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,970
We're going to get there.

213
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,650
But for now we are get we are really good.

214
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Now on the next few sections we can be doing the guitars right here in the shop section.

215
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,950
So this is actually going to be really fun because we need to create of course the different layouts

216
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,990
just like this is actually going to be easy but this one is going to be the interesting one because

217
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,860
we need to filter.

218
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,110
We need to filter things right now we are getting all the fender ones so we need to have a complete

219
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,870
we need to create all this components to collapse from a mature UI.

220
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,070
We need to create all this logic and it's going to it's going to take a little bit of time but it's

221
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,000
going to be really really fun.

222
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,620
All right.

223
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,640
Let's go to the next section and start with the guitars section.

1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,400
OK so let's start with the fun part which is going to be the checkboxes and the filters and everything

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,880
else.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,020
So first we're going to get this and we need two types of components.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,790
We need the check boxes boxes and we need the actual dropdown right.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,630
We need that.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,650
So let's go first to our component.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,150
Let's go to indicate that J.S. and we will create reusable components right now are going to go to the

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,470
top.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,710
And of course important we need to create it but first are going to imported import import and clinical

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,650
uncoiling call it.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,580
I'm going to call it collapse because it's a collapsable and then check box and then from that that

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,250
you tills for Slash collapse.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,590
Same pretty much the same name called object collapse checkbox just copy paste it and make a small c

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,700
could be a capital C up to you.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,240
And then I'm going to close it.

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,220
Of course we need to create this component and it's going to go to you Tilse.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,900
Now I'm going to put it outside of you tildes could be inside forms but you know that's OK.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,880
So collapse a jackpot checkbox and make it a single.

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,930
Very good.

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:14,940
OK.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,490
So this collapse checkbox we need to do a lot of things.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,440
I think you might be thinking do it is just a collapsable and checkbox.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,460
How hard can it be.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:30,530
Well we need to do a lot of things because we need to use use it with with matyr you I'm sorry.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,000
So OK so first one this is going to be a react class based component.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,810
That's the first thing and I'm going to change that capital C to collapse checkbox.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,940
OK.

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,000
So we are moving in react and we need to bring all although that got to do with material and we need

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,650
to input a lot of things.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,270
So I don't really want to type this one by one.

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:02:00,990
So what I wanted to do is go to the web go to material do I and demos go to the demos section component

32
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,360
demos and go to lists.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,420
Now whenever you go to lists you just scroll down right here until you find that one with the face of

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,120
the guy.

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,540
And I just find a list with a checkbox with the title you know and it checks pop a checkbox in the right

36
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,740
and open the source code on the source at the top.

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,080
You can have all imports.

38
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,610
So we do need to import lists.

39
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,350
We need to import item.

40
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,920
We need to import second secondary action just like this and then item text and we do need a check box.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,860
So I get a copy of this just going to copy and paste it and that's it.

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,060
You know we have a list we have item we have text.

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,820
We have this.

44
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,090
The only thing that you're not getting is the collapse.

45
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:55,270
So I'm going to import this one manually import and then I believe it's collapse from at materials like

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,430
core for Slash and then collapse of course

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,300
and that is it from.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,360
And that is it.

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,100
We pretty much have all we need now.

50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,770
If you for example maybe you're watching this in the future and you don't really have this maybe you

51
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,710
have something else give you a different example.

52
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,290
You will need to possibly deal and manually copy.

53
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,060
That's that's what it says.

54
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,800
Sorry for that.

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,260
You know I can't I cannot help you there.

56
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,140
This is why when we need to do in real life.

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,790
OK.

58
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,740
So we pretty much have all of this.

59
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,530
We will use some font awesome icons and this one will need to manually.

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,290
So import fonde also awesome and then icon.

61
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,570
And it's going to be from Fort awesome.

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,400
You know that weird react for it.

63
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,260
Awesome.

64
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,120
A little bit.

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
You know it's can we are.

66
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,520
I don't know why but that's OK.

67
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,620
And then we need to import at the angle down and angle up this arrow and then when we close that we

68
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,580
have the down arrow.

69
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,260
So we need to import that.

70
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:09,260
So import and it's going to be called a angle down just like this from Fort awesome.

71
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,360
And I believe this is the last one yeah.

72
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,050
Awesome Fun font awesome free.

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,760
It.

74
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,120
So again we just copy the name go down and I'm gonna copy this one.

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,660
Paste it at the bottom and it's angle up.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,870
The other one you know kind of makes sense.

77
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,370
And then going to calls it if you notice you don't need to do this is just what I do.

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,980
And the world is divided by the people who does them I call and the one that they do into it.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,570
But you know again you could be one of those guys that they don't get into it.

80
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,100
That's OK.

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,980
You know it still works OK.

82
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:52,330
So we Whenever with the component loads we will bring the components right the filter and the checkbox

83
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,870
component and now this filter might be open or it might be closed.

84
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,760
So if I reload web page you'll notice right here in the final one that I have this one is open but the

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,200
other one.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,800
This one is close close.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,630
And this one is open so we can decide that whenever we include the component from here.

88
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:21,950
So I'm going to create a state right here called equal open force and then a checked and this check

89
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,140
this array is going to be the finalist.

90
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,060
Whenever we start you know checking boxes.

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,830
Now of course by default it's false.

92
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,650
But we can check.

93
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,700
We can change it whenever we include this on the other components.

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,910
We're going to do that now.

95
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,850
Going to go back to the index and since we do have a collapse checkbox right now we can start you know

96
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,990
including the check boxes.

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,660
So let's go right here.

98
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,310
Let's go to the left.

99
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm going to make some space.

100
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,130
And what I need to do I want to bring this collapse checkbox component and of course we need to pass

101
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,650
a law.

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,030
We're going to do them right now.

103
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:05,000
So first the initial stage so in at the state and this state is going to be the open or close.

104
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,300
I was you know we were just talking.

105
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,390
So this one.

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,010
The first one which is going to be the Brandts is going to be true is going to be open whenever it looks

107
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,460
then we need to pass a title so the title is going to be the text of what is the collapse and this case

108
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,710
will be brand So title equals and then brands.

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,760
All right.

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,600
What is the next.

111
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:33,620
We need to pass the list of what is what we want to know to show when this component has a list of checkboxes.

112
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,980
So I'm going to say list equals 2.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,890
And if you remember we are already using products right here and we've already added the components

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,420
amount to get the brands.

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,080
So everything is going to be inside products that brands of the redux store.

116
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,320
And then at the end when we make some changes on that list of checkboxes we need to trigger function

117
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,380
from within this component so we can trigger different action and go to that route from the on the server

118
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,910
and bring the Filcher.

119
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,080
Of course we are not there yet but I'm going to call it right now.

120
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm going to create it.

121
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,590
So it's going to be handle filters this handle filters will be a function just like this and it will

122
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,350
be receiving the filters from the child child component and then we get to go to a different phone function

123
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,520
called called handle filters.

124
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,450
Pretty much same name right and they handle filters.

125
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,760
We will be passing whatever filters we get from this collapse checkbox OK.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,350
Now one more thing on the handle filters we need to lead the function no with which checkbox is this

127
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,370
one because the all of the checkboxes are the same but the prize is a little bit different.

128
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,090
So we need kind of that function we need to know what are we filtering just checkboxes or our radio

129
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,810
buttons.

130
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,020
So I'm going to say coma I'm going to pass a second argument and this one will be brand you know just

131
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,550
passing the title of whatever we are doing right here.

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,610
Then of course we get to catch it and I'm going to do something else with prices.

133
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,410
Get we have the initial stage the title that we are passing a list and we have to handle filters for

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,030
it.

135
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,410
So I'm going to create this function so we can skip that message.

136
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,900
So handle filters is going to be equal to a function whatever whatever.

137
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,950
And then we just create a function.

138
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,690
OK.

139
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:29,670
So let's go back to the collapse checkbox and do this ok since now we are getting prompts inside collapsed

140
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,350
checkbox.

141
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,490
First I want to grab the initial state so I'm going to go to the component that mount.

142
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,970
You could do it in a different way from the from the static for example.

143
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,830
But I'm going to do it the classical way Actually this is the recommended way.

144
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,640
The other one you should not use for everything.

145
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:58,100
So initial state and this that said state opening close and I'm going to say OK so open is going to

146
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,080
be equal to this that probs that initial state.

147
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,470
So whenever we mount we're always going to get the default that we are passing right here.

148
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,110
And of course it's going to change this state and should change it right here.

149
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,780
All right.

150
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,390
So let's start creating the the checkboxes for the.

151
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,880
They believe that the collapsable.

152
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,280
So the container will be class name.

153
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,070
Open it close.

154
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,840
Collapse.

155
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,060
Collapse.

156
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,060
Underscore items underscore wrapper.

157
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,090
OK.

158
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,850
Now inside of here we need a list.

159
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,620
And this actually from material you let me go back a list.

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,510
So this is from material you are.

161
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,940
I'm not making this up of course.

162
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,790
So this list I will need to add a board there bottom note notice that list list it's collapsable has

163
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,860
a border.

164
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,960
So I'm going to add it manually so we can override a part of the initial stylings of Mattioli.

165
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,930
I'm so bored there just like this and bottom and one pixel's solid.

166
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,580
And it's a great color.

167
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,770
So dbd BTB.

168
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,650
All right.

169
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,240
So then of course we get two different things.

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,550
You can get the title which is which is where we're going to click to open and close.

171
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,930
And then at the bottom we have the list of checkboxes which is the actual probable.

172
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,370
So this ones are kind of a no not related.

173
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,700
This is kind of a div where we can bind on unclick and whenever we click it this second list the second

174
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,330
div you can open it close and drop or drop.

175
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,910
So they are kind of a related but not really so.

176
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,250
OK so since we have a list I need to add a list item.

177
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,960
Open and Close.

178
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,210
Now whenever we do an unclick on this like this item we're going to do something.

179
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,670
So I'm going to say unclick and I'm going to create a function that calls this handle and then click.

180
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,230
Of course we don't have this function.

181
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,660
I'm going to add it right now.

182
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,100
So handle click opening close and we just do a function.

183
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,460
Now this handle click.

184
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,690
It's really simple.

185
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,510
The only thing we do is we just toggle the staked so this that set stayed open and close and we say

186
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,750
that we want to grab that open that we have the top and we want to change it to true if it's false and

187
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,170
false.

188
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,540
If it's true so does that stayed open.

189
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,770
So if we if it's the open it's close it's Gates follows and we cook it.

190
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,960
We're going to change it to true.

191
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,380
If it's true and we cook it we're going to change it to False.

192
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,860
We just toggling the stick.

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,720
That is that that's the only thing we do right here.

194
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,710
All right.

195
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,750
Skip moving forward now this list item again I'm going to overwrite some of the stylings because I don't

196
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:52,210
really like them and I'm going to close this and this is going to be a pattern because the default panning

197
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,500
of this list item it's a little bit weird.

198
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,490
So 10 pixels 23 pixels 10 pixels 0.

199
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,800
So this one this actually looks nice looks a little bit better than the default one.

200
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,430
All right.

201
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:11,390
I'm going to save it now if you go right here we can see and maybe you notice that I'm making a lot

202
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:17,930
of reference to the final and I could be showing you the Photoshop with design but I don't really want

203
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,330
to do this.

204
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,040
You know this is a better example of what we want to do.

205
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,070
OK.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:30,440
So in real life of course we will be watching the designs so well instead of here we have two pieces.

207
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,090
We have the left which is the title and the ride with the arrow.

208
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,560
And notice that every time we change this state this arrow could be up or it could be down.

209
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,490
So we need to change the names of the font or some icon.

210
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,350
All right.

211
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,780
Actually we need to change the font or some icon.

212
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,840
OK.

213
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,620
So we have two parts.

214
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm going to create a list.

215
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,090
Let me do it correctly list.

216
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:05,440
An item and text just remember that we've imported this at the top I'm going to make it a self-closing

217
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,300
tech opening close.

218
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,010
Now this one takes a primary and the primary it's the title.

219
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,450
So the title is going to be this problem.

220
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,130
And remember we're passing the title from here title.

221
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,930
So I was going to get this.

222
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,350
That prompts a title.

223
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,330
Then we need to add a class name so I can override some of the default Starling's you know the font

224
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,600
and everything else.

225
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,760
So class name I call this collapse underscore title.

226
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,450
All right.

227
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,150
Then we have the the R.O. the up and down.

228
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:49,590
And I'm going to do this inside a function so handle and then angle if you can think of a better name.

229
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,120
You're welcome to use to use it.

230
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,570
So again I'm going to create and remember that we are using a class based component so you can do something

231
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,960
like this and it's still going to work completely up to you.

232
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:13,900
So on this one we'll just you know change the icon if it's the state it's open or it's not open right

233
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,670
if it's true or false.

234
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,010
So inside this handle toggle a handle Well I'm going to return some GSX.

235
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,740
So there's that state not open.

236
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,610
If it's true we will do something.

237
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,610
If not we will do something else.

238
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,210
So what are we going to be returning.

239
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,630
Is the font awesome icon opening close.

240
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,890
Now we need to pass the name of the icon.

241
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,920
So the first one.

242
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,660
I can't.

243
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,090
If it's true it's going to be that it's up.

244
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,210
Right.

245
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,950
And depending on the application this might change.

246
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,600
Some people like to do it you know the other way round.

247
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,860
So class name icon and I'm going to do pretty much the same thing.

248
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,820
We could just create a sink component and just change the name right here.

249
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,520
You could do that.

250
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,920
Now think about it.

251
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,010
All right.

252
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,510
So angled down

253
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,890
all right that is good.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,950
So let's go back.

255
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,820
And of course I have it right here.

256
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,170
So if I click it remember that we are already changing the state we have right here to open and to false.

257
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,680
So if we click it we are able to change the art.

258
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,120
So everything's working right.

259
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,560
And I think about it this is actually something we could do with F.A. angle maybe with the ternary just

260
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,250
return one single piece of code and check if it's open and return this or return that we could do that

261
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,560
for now.

262
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:41,980
That's OK.

263
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,830
I'm just going to leave it like this.

264
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,350
All right.

265
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,650
So what do we need it now.

266
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,320
We need the actual collapsable.

267
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,890
So I'm going to go outside of collapse outside of the I'm sorry the list item and I'm going to say call

268
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,800
ups Oh getting close.

269
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,220
Now let's go on the collapse.

270
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm going to say I don't know maybe item text is going to copy and paste it right here.

271
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,030
Of course we are not going to really use this.

272
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:16,920
So with the collapse we need to pass some properties and some of them are really required.

273
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,410
So the one that is required the most important thing is going to be what is the state of this.

274
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,670
It's it's collapsed or not collapsed and this one it's inside in whenever we do in we do we do.

275
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,890
True or we do false.

276
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,530
And if you remember we have this on the does that state that open.

277
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,500
So this state that open.

278
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,310
Right.

279
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:44,300
We are going to pass some more defaults so we have a timeout and I'm going to say no.

280
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,350
And we have one more property which is mount on exit.

281
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,920
And this ones are from material.

282
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,330
All right.

283
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,990
Right now it is open.

284
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,900
That's why we get the second brands.

285
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,980
If I click it we close it and their works are good.

286
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:07,350
So now our only job right now the only thing left is to add the list of checkboxes.

287
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,710
So this one will be rendering will would be rendering a list.

288
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,110
It is a list of checkboxes but it's just a list.

289
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:22,190
So I'm going to say what is the component that we want to render as a list of components and I'm going

290
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,770
to say dear.

291
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,780
And again this is a prop from material you I and lists.

292
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,020
Now I want to disable the padding but because by default on the lists they give you a weird padding.

293
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,930
So disable panning and this one this one is going to remove the paddings.

294
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,650
Now of course nothing is going to really happen right here.

295
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,150
So we need to create a list.

296
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:53,450
So I to create a function to render a list that is Dudd render render list and we are always there.

297
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,430
Not that there are but we are almost there.

298
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,400
OK.

299
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,920
So I'm going to copy the name of the function.

300
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,750
Go right here at bottom and create it render list open and close and we will be returning some GSX so

301
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,140
open and close.

302
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,510
Now what do we need to do.

303
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:16,360
We need to grab whatever we are getting as a list of products you know and create that text right here.

304
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,710
And the checkbox and right now that's fine.

305
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,710
OK.

306
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,260
Render list.

307
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,610
So very good.

308
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,850
This I believe I'm using the same name.

309
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,860
So OK.

310
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,980
That is good because because we are not returning anything.

311
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,510
So first I need to check that we have we do have something inside this that props list.

312
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:42,740
So if we do have something we're going to do something if not we will not return anything.

313
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:50,750
Now what we need to do we need to map the list so this that prompts that list and then we map over it.

314
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:57,310
I'm going to open it close and for each one we will be getting a value now opening close.

315
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
And there we go.

316
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,000
And for now I'm just going to return dip.

317
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,440
And with the with something inside of course we're going to get many brands.

318
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,130
And that is the server.

319
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,870
So we get it open and we have all the list of brands.

320
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,310
Now let's check.

321
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,400
What is the structure of this.

322
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,680
So we have brands and for each brand we have an ID and we have a name.

323
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:28,700
Now if we stop for one second and we think what what can happen with this when we make a request to

324
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,310
the server what are we going to be really using the name of the category or the ID.

325
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,520
And if you remember again inside products because it's what we're going to be filtering products we

326
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:49,620
store everything we store the brand with the I.D. not with the with the name so we should use the idea

327
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,280
instead.

328
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,340
Right.

329
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,700
So let's go back to render list and what we will be rendering since we have a list.

330
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,370
It's a list item.

331
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,280
So I'm going to do this.

332
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,730
I'm going to say list item.

333
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,640
Open and close and let me check if this went too long oh it's already went so long.

334
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,440
So we're going to continue this on the next section.

335
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:19,160
We get a created list item with the of course the text of the checkbox and then the actual checkbox.

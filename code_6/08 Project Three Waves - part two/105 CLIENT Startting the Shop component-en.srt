1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,080
OK so let's continue with this.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,680
So if we go to the stars and I'm going to go to the final one if you go to the TAR's we get the shop

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,470
section for last shop and right here in the left side of the top and have a bar.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,380
And this is going to be reusable very simple reusable components because when we go to products we pretty

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,170
much have the name of the section.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,890
So again we're going to create it and it's going to be very simple that at the bottom we have the right

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,060
side and the left side and on the left we'll have a lot of filters and all of the sections.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,540
You know the brands and the woods just like with the with the server.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,090
We need to fetch two categories from the server.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,630
Now for the price and not for the frets.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,990
And of course when we select them we need to do some magic with the state and something else and we

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,610
need to filter everything.

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,100
For example if I felt a fender and would filter frets of course we're going to do some filtering.

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,090
We're going to filter by both.

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,160
That is the main idea going to remove this and make it a little nicer.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,510
And of course in the right we're going to get all the carts we can show them.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,650
And of course we can change the grid.

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,740
And if we are pretty much doing all we can do a load more and load more products.

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,400
OK.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,310
So again we will need to do a lot of things.

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,290
So let's start small.

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,630
I'm going to go to our component right here to components.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,330
And of course we need a section where we're going to be putting all of this.

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,860
I'm going to call the section shop could be products or buy or you know whatever doesn't matter.

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,450
It's completely up to you.

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,750
It's going to create an index not just because it's the main thing we need.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,340
And of course this one is going to be a re-act class based component because we need to do a lot of

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,240
things.

29
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,330
OK.

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,460
So I'm going to call that shop of course just like the name.

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:01,470
So it's going to be shop copy shop and then shop and then going to say just job whatever.

32
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,150
Now of course since we want to use the route we need to add it to routes.

33
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,470
So I'm going to go right here at the top and noticed that this ones are kind of a public and this one

34
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,330
is not so all the other main routes I'm using is paysan using just a different place where I can see

35
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,990
them.

36
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:31,210
So I'm going to say important and then jump from that forward slash components for Slash and then shop.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,110
And that is it.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,230
We don't need everything anything else.

39
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,020
OK.

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,880
So I'm going to copy the name again.

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,490
Right right here we have the admin and right here we have the public the public ones.

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,340
So and then copy home because this is just like home.

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,930
I'm going to put it right here.

44
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,080
So it's going to be shop the components going to be shop still out.

45
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,310
And still no.

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,010
And the location is going to be shut.

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,300
All right.

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,820
So we go to our project and I go to guitars.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,320
We get to shop.

50
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,810
So that is good.

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,430
What is the first thing we're going to do.

52
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,420
We're going to do this the the peach top I called the page top.

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,880
So I'm going to store this inside tills because later whenever we go to a new product we have pretty

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,540
much the same section the same component.

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,950
So we're going to do that.

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,030
We're going to import it right here the top of course it doesn't exist begin to create right now.

57
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:32,550
So Page top from Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot for Slash.

58
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,190
It's going to be tails for Slash page underscore top.

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:44,180
Of course we need to create this so get a copy go to Eutelsat and create a new file Coale call the page

60
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,930
tab.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,270
Yes.

62
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,100
So again whenever we change routes this is going to be displaying the name of the route and from within

63
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,380
the parent component.

64
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,430
We're going to be passing the name of the section to page top.

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,030
It's going to be a very simple component so react statelets component just like this.

66
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,780
And it's called page and then tab right.

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,310
And we're going to be we're seeing some prompts and then we will return something simple.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,170
It's a class name off page tab.

69
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:25,040
And inside I'm going to put a container so we can put everything in the middle container and inside

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
of the container.

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,460
I get a pass the props.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,530
That title maybe and just maybe on the bonus section are going to do something else right here because

73
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,810
maybe we are right here in a click fender.

74
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,650
So I would like to get this tax convert to something and maybe put a line right here and show the tax

75
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,980
you know do that kind of a breadcrumb or something like that.

76
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,050
But you know right now it's not really that important.

77
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,580
So we can do it much later.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,350
Maybe we are going to do it much later.

79
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,500
As a bonus.

80
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,330
OK.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,370
So let's move forward.

82
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:03,380
We have the page top so I'm going to go back to index and of course we need to do a lot more here before

83
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,620
we can do the pitch top begin to use redux because we need to fetch a list of brands and the list of

84
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,150
words from the server.

85
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:25,600
So import connect import that connect from and then react and then redux the Rigaud.

86
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,890
OK.

87
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,990
For now that is good.

88
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,940
We need to import a lot of things.

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,290
But right now Kinect is just that.

90
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:32,960
All right.

91
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,460
So of course let's go at the bottom export default connect to opening close and I'm going to close shop

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:40,850
now.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,500
We will be using maps take the prompts.

94
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,900
So I'm going to say map state to Propst just like this and delete the prompts and we will be returning

95
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,350
products because we need to do the request to the server.

96
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,200
And this will return everything inside products so we need we need access to products.

97
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,670
So far so good.

98
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,560
So let's go to the Render I'm going to go to the render and start creating the main layout for this.

99
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,940
So we're going to make a lot of references to this problem.

100
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,240
So I'm going to say Konst products equals this that props the products.

101
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,480
So now we don't need to do this problem that this that prompts anymore we just make a reference to products

102
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,820
and that is it.

103
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:26,560
OK.

104
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:34,010
So on the main div I'm going to include the page top so I'm going to say opening close and self-closing

105
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,730
Takk page top.

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:45,180
I'm going to pass that title Propp title equals to browse products.

107
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,510
All right.

108
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,610
There we go.

109
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,750
So in theory we should be getting something Dhokha we can get it.

110
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,830
I'm not getting the title it's because a mistake title

111
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,520
we get Brion's products same thing than here Burguet.

112
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:10,440
OK so until now we need to divide the rest of the ad the the container right here into a container right.

113
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,440
We need to center pretty much everything and then kind of divided with the left and then divided with

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,980
the right side.

115
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,680
OK.

116
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,140
So we're going to go right here.

117
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,110
Open and close.

118
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,990
And this is going to be a container.

119
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:33,990
So class name of container and the layout for this is going to be very simple.

120
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,880
So lay of container are going to add one more wrapper just like this.

121
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:45,360
And this one is going to be class name of shampoo rubber OK.

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,810
And then of course we have the left side and we have the right side.

123
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,780
So div class name will be left.

124
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,520
And that class name of right.

125
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,290
So if I put left right here and I put right we should be getting something at least.

126
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,620
All right.

127
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,820
So let's go here and we get left and we get right.

128
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,030
So that is good.

129
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,850
So what are we going to do next.

130
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,560
We going to go in order and the first I would like to do everything that they got to do with the filter

131
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,310
because if we make a request after we filter everything we can actually do the console log and check

132
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,170
that we are getting the information or we can even go to redux.

133
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,700
So this is not really that important right now.

134
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,390
This is important part of the application right now.

135
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:37,630
Right.

136
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,630
So what do we need to do next before we create anything we need to do we need the data actually we need

137
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,820
to use right here we need to France and the woods and for this of course we need to make a network request

138
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,110
to our server so we can we can get it right.

139
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,710
All right.

140
00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:00,180
So of course we're going to create two different functions so we can we can dispatch an action so important

141
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,640
and close and I'm going to call it get Brandt's because we need to get Brandt's and then get word because

142
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,330
we need to get what and what's pleural from that that force Slashdot that that force slash and then

143
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,990
actions for Slash and up products.

144
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,670
Right.

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,890
Of course we didn't have them.

146
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,620
We need to create them right now.

147
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,580
So I'm going to save this and they're going to go to the actions directory and product actions.

148
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,060
And of course we need to start cleaning them right now.

149
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,390
I'm going to play it I'm going to split this with categories because of course we are getting products

150
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,030
but we are getting the integrity of the product the product and are going to copy the name here and

151
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,980
I'm going to go over here and say export function.

152
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,870
I'm going to paste it and then I'm going to just create a function just like this.

153
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,560
We are using this you could read up on our function right here.

154
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,270
It's just pretty much the same thing.

155
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,960
So export function and it's going to call get votes.

156
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,460
Same thing of course at the end we're going to get an error because we are not returning anything from

157
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,890
here so that that we know that.

158
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,530
OK.

159
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:19,000
So we need to create the types so coma and then get what we could call this get worse or you know fecche

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,910
words are going to culturist get Brandt maybe get words what's going to copy the types and I'm going

161
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,080
to open types because we need to add them.

162
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,550
And since they are related to products I'm going to put them right here.

163
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm going to paste copy the export Konst just to make a little bit faster and then equal.

164
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,130
Same thing right here.

165
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,890
Export Konst equal to something.

166
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,020
And of course we need to add this and we need to do this manually at Brandt's.

167
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,410
We closed it and then it got worse or it got worse.

168
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,290
So very good.

169
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,780
Now we have the product actions we are importing we have functions and types and everything else.

170
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,070
So in theory I'm going to open reducers.

171
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,390
I'm going to go to products reducer and we get a need to do the same thing for the types we need to

172
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:21,520
bring the types get brands and get Woods Komar get brands and get what's very good of course we need

173
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,420
to add the case right here.

174
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:33,010
So can be very simple really real simple case get Brandt's and make it right get Brandt's.

175
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:39,600
And of course if you get Brandt's we will return opening close data that we return to state coma.

176
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:47,950
And I don't know we could call Brant's action that payload Burguet are going to copy to get Brant's

177
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,670
because it's pretty much the same same thing.

178
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:57,460
So get Brant's this one will be get woods and then it's going to be what's an action that they look

179
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,140
really simple we were not doing anything new and actually you could cut to the chase if you ask me.

180
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,100
And since you want to get categories instead of creating a route where you can just get one category

181
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,170
and just well go to one database where you could do you can of course fetch different things from the

182
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,940
database.

183
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,370
And then internally from the server create an object with two categories Brandt's and woods and you

184
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,640
will be each year you know just getting the brands and the words on the same route from the same request.

185
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,140
So when you get back to just get back in contact with Brandt's and woods right now we are practicing

186
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:38,560
and at the same time I'm assuming that maybe you're learning right now all of the developers are really

187
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,640
experienced as experienced.

188
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,660
So I'm just trying to split things up so it gets a little bit easier to understand.

189
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:53,350
But of course if if we could make something better something a little bit smaller or smarter I can tell

190
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,930
you you know you could just read one route and do both things but it's completely up to you if you want

191
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,780
to try it.

192
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,250
Yeah.

193
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,910
Goodman go and try it.

194
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,570
OK.

195
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,080
So we have to get Brandt's we have the types we have the reducers.

196
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,990
We pretty much have everything.

197
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,120
So right now we're going to be it we're going to fetch the information.

198
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,340
So I will go inside of the class and of course we need to do this.

199
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,720
This is what prompted this patch from the component at Mount component that Mount open and close and

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,030
we do this that when we make it right there's that props that dispatch

201
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,070
patch opening close and we get to get Brent's right.

202
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,460
So after get Brant's I'm going to do get what's in it for us at the end.

203
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,220
We're going to get everything in injected inside props.

204
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,620
Right.

205
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,300
That is the whole idea.

206
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,710
And why we're using maps to props.

207
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh and of course I need to pass it right here to the connect sorry for that.

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,270
All right.

209
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,130
So let's see what happens.

210
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,940
The application really renders.

211
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,870
And there's the props and maybe I made a mistake.

212
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,720
Of course of course.

213
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,460
Sorry I forgot to do something we forgot to do the reaction of request.

214
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,570
Sorry for that.

215
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,060
Sorry.

216
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,420
OK.

217
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,280
So again really really simple.

218
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,390
We do a concert and I'm going to do the first one to get France and then I'm going to copy and change

219
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,590
the change.

220
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,890
What we we actually need to print.

221
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:31,840
So constant ASIO's that get opening close and it's going to be from products we have it right here the

222
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,480
products sever and the get it's Brandt's.

223
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,050
All right.

224
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:50,070
After that we can again respond the issues of response equals to reads pongs DOD data.

225
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,400
All right

226
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,540
that I'm going to take one more thing.

227
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,100
And this is just sometimes I do it like this.

228
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,450
If the project is not really really complicated why do I create a different function that it's not been

229
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,670
exported anywhere.

230
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:08,950
Right.

231
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:14,330
It's a function of fear could be a functioning side misc or you know something like that.

232
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,960
And what I do is create different types of requests I just create again a function that handles get

233
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,760
requests right.

234
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,550
Is the only thing that is going to do.

235
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,920
And of course at the end it just returns something simple.

236
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,480
You know this is a very simple request.

237
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,690
There is no configuration there's no nothing.

238
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,300
So what you can do instead of writing little of everything just every time you do a request you just

239
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,440
can create a function that does this that receives maybe one or two arguments depending on what you

240
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
want to do.

241
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,120
And that is it.

242
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,240
And you just create the request it later uses says you can just create a function get my data just like

243
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,530
this.

244
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,840
And at the end you know this will get resolved and returned.

245
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,890
So you could do that.

246
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,360
You could do something like that.

247
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,530
I did that many many times depending on the project of course.

248
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:05,260
Sometimes that requires they get really really weird because you know you need to do a lot of things

249
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,860
first or something like that.

250
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,710
But you know this is a good example.

251
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,560
Just create a function that handle handles simple requests and that is it.

252
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,810
So again you could do that.

253
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:25,120
So I'm going to return opening close and I'm going to return to type and a payload.

254
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,630
All right.

255
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:35,500
So if you remember we helped get Brandt's so we passed the type get prints and then request.

256
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,060
All right.

257
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,310
So we have the type and the payload.

258
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,060
Now on this one it's going to be the same thing for the get go.

259
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,790
That's why I'm telling you you could create just a function to avoid repeating pretty much the same

260
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,800
code.

261
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,120
It's not the same because we have different kind of a different route to our arguments.

262
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,380
But it's pretty much the same.

263
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,730
So this one is instead of get Brant's is going to get worse.

264
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,540
All right that is get.

265
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,270
So now at least it works.

266
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,770
We're not getting an error message.

267
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,020
So of course we have dev tools.

268
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,990
So if we go to state we get products we get the Brandts and we get the word so we are ready to work

269
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,680
with this.

270
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,980
We can get the products and the words from within the store.

271
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,360
And you know generate all of this.

272
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,480
Now we can get used for example this one the checkbox you can use it three times.

273
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:36,030
So there's no point in copying pasting the same component three times with different properties.

274
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:43,100
So we can read a reusable component because again maybe we can use it later on other sections.

275
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,450
So we're going to create a reusable component for this.

276
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,410
This one went too long.

277
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,150
Let's go to the next one and start with the reusable components of the checkbox.

1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,090
All right so let's try to render something here you know render the carts first.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,840
So OK so I'm going to do the following.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,970
I'm not going to I've just rendered the cards.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,120
I'm going to close and close everything inside of a different component called load more carts because

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,750
maybe in the future this is of course I haven't decided yet this yet.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,670
Maybe instead of doing the load more I will show you a different component.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,110
But with pagination and of course we need to change them.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,800
Some other things to do pagination instead of a lot more but I could add it as MOTOS as a bonus or not.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,720
So I'm going to enclose everything into a new component.

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,350
I'm going to go to shop creating new filed code load more and then cartes.

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,410
Yeah why not.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:54,490
Cartes capital C cartes dodginess the load more cards is going to be ever yakked stateless component

13
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,270
for now.

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,490
Could be could be a class based component re-act stateless component.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,010
There you go could be a class based component but yeah that's OK.

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,430
Load more cards.

17
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,050
Right.

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,100
Of course we need to include it at the top.

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:27,220
So I'm going to go over here the top and import load more cards from that forward slash load more carts.

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,780
All right.

21
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,310
Burguet so I'm going to go here and make a reference to this to this.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,170
And of course I need to add more more things right here because in the right side we will have this

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,720
grid and this thing.

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,900
So I'm going to create the layout for this and we're going to do this at the end because it's you know

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,750
not really that important and it is just something we add.

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:56,170
So I'm going to add a class name inside of right with shop options and instead of here are going to

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,560
add a new div with a class name.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,600
Class of shop Gritz space.

29
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm going to add it clear because I use floats for this one right now at the top.

30
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,430
Nothing is going to happen.

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to say just Gritz.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,270
Now after the Shub options I going add a new depth.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,920
So I'm going to go right here and this is where we're going to be putting all the carts.

34
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,930
So I'm going to make a reference to load more carts.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,930
Now of course we need to pass a lot of props.

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,850
We need that grid that we're using at the top right here that we are not really using right now but

37
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,640
to use it in a couple of minutes.

38
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:45,700
So I'm going to say grid opening close this that state that grid than going past the limit.

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:53,810
Remember that we need the limit so this that state that limit are going to be passing the size size.

40
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:02,620
And remember that we have this inside redux so prop products we are bringing in here products we are

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,220
going to bring products and then I believe we called it to shop size.

42
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,940
In short yes to shop size.

43
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,420
Right.

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,890
So we have the sites that we need the actual products of course products equals two products and we

45
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,640
call it to shop.

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,860
Right so its products to shop.

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,330
And then again to create a function which is going to be a lot more with a capital M load more equals

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,220
opening closed.

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,290
And this will be a function.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,470
We don't have this function.

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,430
So for now I'm going to do console log load more.

52
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,380
We're going to do the load more at the end.

53
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,550
Okay.

54
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,140
So now we have this component that it's not of course it's not really doing anything.

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,340
Now of course you're catching the props and inside of the red the return of course we need to return

56
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,890
something.

57
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,370
So I can go inside the div.

58
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,570
And again to create one div at the top so to open it close.

59
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,090
Right here we're going to be rendering the carts.

60
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,380
Now if you remember we've kind of already use a container to render the carts at home.

61
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,100
Maybe you remember this one right here.

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,010
So we can not really use this one.

63
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,980
It's a little bit different than the one we need to use right here.

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,940
So we need to create again a reusable component that it's almost sink.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,750
But of course we have a lot of changes.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,690
So instead of going to go to your tills and creating a new file and this one will be Karl called Card

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,680
underscore blague pretty much the same thing.

68
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:41,380
BLOCK And then underscore and then shop that is the difference is a different file.

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,070
All right let's look at imported at the top.

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:53,500
So import card block and then shop with a capital S..

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,380
There we go shop from and dot dot for Slash.

72
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,520
You'll tell us your tails.

73
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,950
Sorry for slashing sales.

74
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,640
Forward slash and cart lock shop.

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,360
All right.

76
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,940
Burguet now going to make a reference to this and this component what it's going to be expecting it

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,240
is the grid which is the lay out we're going to be using on the cards and that this that props up sorry

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,470
its props not this it's props.

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,220
And we will be passing the grade we get from props.

80
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,530
And then of course we need the list.

81
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,470
So list equals props that props that list.

82
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,970
All right.

83
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,330
This is the only thing we need later right here.

84
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,550
We're going to be adding the load more button right here.

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,650
But we can do it later.

86
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,860
Not right now.

87
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,410
All right.

88
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,970
So this component is very very simple.

89
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,230
So of course now we need to do the card lock shop.

90
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,230
So let's go to card block shop.

91
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,530
So this component is going to be re-act stateless component.

92
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,490
Right.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,070
Going to call it card block and then shop this one again will be receiving prompts.

94
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,460
And again it's just a simple a simple component that we need to pass the class name of the container

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,580
and card block and then shop OK.

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,880
Now inside of here I going to create a div container and we could receive a title.

97
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,930
I'm going to add it right now but maybe we want to add a title just like we did with the other component.

98
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,430
So you can actually pass this prop but I'm not going to really do the title right now.

99
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,370
I'm just going to create a new container and it's out of here.

100
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,550
Will we be getting the props that list.

101
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,840
So I got to say props that list.

102
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,270
So if we do are getting props that list from the from the props.

103
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,680
We're going to do something if not we're going to do something.

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,230
We're going to do something else.

105
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,780
All right.

106
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,790
Now if we do have props list could happen that maybe the user choose something where we don't really

107
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,810
have products.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,390
So we need to tell the user.

109
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,390
Sorry.

110
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,490
Nothing was found or something like that.

111
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,690
So once we are into two propolis we are making sure that we do have that property.

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,130
So I'm going to enter to prompts that list.

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:26,140
And again to check the length so length and if it's equal to zero then we want to show a message right.

114
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,620
And if not we're going to say nothing.

115
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,300
And what I'm going to say it's something very simple Dave.

116
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:43,510
Opening close can attach a class name and no result and it's going to say no sorry no results.

117
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,870
Get if we of course if we do have something we're going to run a different function after this.

118
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,730
So I'm going to go right here and say render cards open and closed.

119
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,280
And I'm going to be passing the props that list.

120
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,370
Remember that inside promp we have the list and the grid.

121
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
OK.

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,870
So now instead of undercards Konst render cards it's equal to a function.

123
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:17,010
And of course we want to return some GSX and what we will be returning is the card component we have

124
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,480
right here.

125
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,340
We just need to map and return a card for each.

126
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:29,770
So I'm going to import cart from that that forward slash tails for a slash and then cart.

127
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,780
All right.

128
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:39,960
So can enter I'm going to say prompts that list and if we do have something we return something.

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,860
Now if we do have something I want to enter that prompts that list and I want to map.

130
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,760
Now whenever I map I can to get a card.

131
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,440
All the data about that card.

132
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,840
And we we turn some GSX at the end Burguet.

133
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,410
So what we return is the card.

134
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,080
So open close.

135
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:05,010
Card this card needs a key because we are looping something and this is react and I'm going to say that

136
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,480
begin to use the card underscore ID which is the ID of the actual article then going to go right here

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,600
and I'm going to say that dot dot dot and cart.

138
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,780
So whatever property I'm getting from the card you know the name the id the brands and everything else

139
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,380
are going to attach it to here and then are going to be passing the grid that begin to do much later.

140
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,610
So the grid and I are passing the probs dot grid

141
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,260
looks nice.

142
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,270
Let's see if we get something.

143
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,110
And we are not getting anything.

144
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,930
Let's see if I get a mistake honor maybe.

145
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,150
I'm pretty sure I forgot to do something.

146
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,660
That's OK.

147
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,340
All right well let me check what I forgot.

148
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,620
And drew back.

149
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,470
OK.

150
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,710
I'm sorry for this.

151
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,020
I made a mistake right here so I'm making reference to a lot more cars and passing products and right

152
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,770
here I'm sending list.

153
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,060
So this one should be products.

154
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,170
I'm going to save it.

155
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,470
It's going to reload and we get it you know we get the we get the carts.

156
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,690
Very good man.

157
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,620
All right.

158
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,700
OK.

159
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,790
So the next step is going to be doing the load more because right now by default we get the first six.

160
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,520
Right.

161
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,060
So whenever we get the we clicked the load more I went to get six digit results with the same properties

162
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,300
and arguments right here.

163
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,170
But you know the next six not this ones.

164
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,510
So let's see if I click on Fender.

165
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,660
We are getting from their friends.

166
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,080
So the filters are working.

167
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,250
Vendor Ivan us I get friends or Ivan us and remember that for example if I click Charvel Charvel or

168
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,260
Millie Jackson or something like that we we're going to get more than six results.

169
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,270
But the thing is that we only see sex you're not getting more results by default.

170
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,700
It's always 6.

171
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,060
Right.

172
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,280
And this is what we're going to be modifying on a lot more.

173
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,060
OK.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,870
So let's let's go to the next section and do the load more.

1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,990
All right so now we are going to be creating the radio component.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,150
OK.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,630
Just like with the collapse checkbox we need to do a lot of things but we're not going to spend a lot

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,600
of time on the collapse radio because a lot of the things we haven't collapsed checkbox begin to be

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,370
we're using them so we're going to do a lot of copy paste.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,160
OK.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,750
So we're going to go to you tell us your file collapse radio that.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,010
Yes of course the radio itself is different and the collapse checkbox but you know the functions they

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,770
pretty much look the same everything else.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,860
So the Columbus radio will be a re-act class based component so I'm going to create it right now collapse

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,180
radio whenever whatever.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,530
There we go.

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:56,180
So import import collapse and I'm going to do it just like this collapse and then radio from DOT DOT

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,630
forward slash you tels for Slash.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,480
And that collapse radio of course.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,860
Right now we need to call it.

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,270
So I'm going to copy this one and paste it at the bottom and I'm just going to change the name tag.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,370
So collapse radio the initial state will be the same but this one is going to change it to True and

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,850
I change this one to false.

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,710
That's correct.

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,300
So the title of course needs to be something else because now we are working working with prices.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,910
So this one is going to be price list and this one is a little bit weird.

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,530
I'm going to say price now.

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,560
We didn't have this list.

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,890
We're going to create it from fixed categories.

26
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,580
So inside handle filters will be we will be handing price.

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,080
All right now let's go to fix ecoterrorists because we need to add them manually.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm sorry for this but we need to do it.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,470
And in the meanwhile I'm going explain you because the array of objects it's a little bit weird.

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,430
So price equals an array of objects.

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:03,640
The first one just like the other ones will have an underscore ID right on and square ID when you know

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,570
right now zero.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,810
And this is just the ID.

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,090
We have many values.

35
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,850
One two three four five six.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
So will have ID 0 1 2 3 4 5 6.

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,070
Right.

38
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,360
Then we have a name and the name is what its going to be get.

39
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,520
Getting this played right here.

40
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,390
So we need a name.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:33,070
All right name and the name in the on the first one is any because of course at any price then we have

42
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,780
a problem.

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,570
So if we think about this for one second whenever we select a category from the collapse checkbox we

44
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:47,170
pass the value we have in site name or the value we have inside ID as get actually the ID but we can

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,750
pass zero because when we go to the server what are we going to say we want to bring all the products

46
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,450
with a price zero or and then zero to 1 or 2 1 to 2.

47
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,550
Well thats not going to happen you know we have a problem there.

48
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,650
So what are you going to do going at an array.

49
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,660
So I'm going to say re open and close and the first one is going to be empty because we are not filtering

50
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,770
by any kind of price.

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,790
I would copy this one and Im going to paste it at the bottom and this one will be id of one and the

52
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:27,790
values are going to change because now its from 0 2 and I don't know 300 right 300 could be ninety nine

53
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,040
or something like that and we make it look so it can make a little bit more sense.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,090
Zero to two ninety nine.

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,280
Now when we go to the server to search you know a value from where to where we going to be passing an

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,870
array with two values.

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,610
The first one is going to be the from and the second one is going to be the two.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,980
So again instead of parenting and ID when it comes to prizes we will pass the rate we can to go to the

59
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,560
server and search all the products with the price between zero dollars and 2 8:51.

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
Thats why we do on a rate.

61
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,990
All right.

62
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,610
And the same thing with the other ones so I'm going to copy paste the ID of this one.

63
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,740
Going to be 2 and it's from 299 2 and 8 9 2.

64
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,160
I don't know if 5 Nine-Nine makes sense actually sorry it's 300.

65
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,200
Because tonight 9 the next one is 300.

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,990
And the next one.

67
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,140
599 Okay.

68
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:34,360
And of course the array it's again 300 to 5 9 9.

69
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,300
So for that 5 9 9.

70
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,600
So then I get a copy.

71
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,630
I'm going to go right here and I can say name again five by nine.

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,180
This one is 600 and the next one it's going to be $999.

73
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,570
So this is a very good price for a guitar.

74
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,380
You know a guitar for this price is a good guitar.

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:06,060
Six hundred and then nine a 9 0 2 2 9 9 and 300 2 9 5 9 9 to $600.

76
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,110
Not a good price.

77
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,650
No it's a shitty guitar.

78
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,530
So don't buy it.

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,360
All right.

80
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,220
So in that coma we have the ID of number four and we have instead of 600.

81
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,010
We have what nine or nine.

82
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,900
It's going to be a thousand dollars sorry.

83
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,530
And we get to go to $2000.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,530
So a guitar of $2000 is a professional guitar.

85
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,060
So if you have the money and you want to play guitar professionally that's what you need to spend.

86
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,970
Sorry for that.

87
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,530
Get a copy

88
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:52,120
and the next one it's the last one because more than two more than $2000 is a boutique guitar custom

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,100
shop guitar.

90
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:01,900
So we're going to go right here and say more than $2000.

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,500
All right.

92
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,670
So I'm going to say 2000 and right here we need to pass a value.

93
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,690
So I'm going to put a ridiculous amount of money.

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,920
All right so whatever it's up to a thousand dollars we going to get it.

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,500
OK.

96
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,850
So this is why we have the ideas 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5.

97
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,610
So we have six type values.

98
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Let me just make sure I type everything correctly 6 2 9 9 1 2 2 and then 2 2.

99
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,170
Yeah I think it looks nice.

100
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,970
Okay.

101
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,760
Sorry for this but we kind of need to do it.

102
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,980
So now I need to include it and I forgot to export it.

103
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,370
Price and we bring price.

104
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,090
So now the collapse radio will be getting a list of prices.

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,400
All right.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,240
So let's keep moving forward on the collapse of radio.

107
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,070
We will need a bunch of stuff just like have with the collapse checkbox.

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm going to put it right here.

109
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,220
I'm going to go at the top.

110
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,190
We will need the font awesome icon same icons.

111
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,230
So I'm going to copy.

112
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,860
I'm going to paste now I'm going to go right here at the bottom and we need a lot of things from here.

113
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,690
And we need to delete some of them so we will still list.

114
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,260
We will list a list item we will need.

115
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,020
And I'm just going to arrange this.

116
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:27,830
We will need let a list item text we will need the collapse is going to put it right here.

117
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:34,080
We don't need the list item the list item second reaction and we don't need to check box.

118
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:42,160
Of course we need to import some other things so import are going to say radio from opening close ad

119
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:49,150
material you ice core for Slash radio what else we need.

120
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,960
One more thing I'm going to copy so I don't have to type everything again.

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,500
So we need something that calls radio group which is going to ingroup all of the radios.

122
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:06,260
So radio group we have one more one more which is form control label.

123
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:15,230
So I'm going to say form control and then label label them that is good.

124
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,950
Let me make it right.

125
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,520
OK.

126
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,070
Form control label is correct.

127
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,210
And then for control label and that is it.

128
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,020
That's all we need.

129
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,700
One two three four five six seven.

130
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,810
Let's look at that that's all we need.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,630
Now again just like with the collapse checkbox we need a state with the initial state of the collapse

132
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,580
which is going to be open falls and then instead of the checked remember that on radios we can have

133
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,930
only one value.

134
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,110
So instead of checked is going to be value of zero.

135
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,910
OK.

136
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,500
So right here we need the components around from member to handle the State of the.

137
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,460
You know if it's open or closed.

138
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,170
So we will do the same thing just copy and paste right.

139
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,490
And if we think about this we could create a component to show a collapsable and then inside create

140
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,750
a different component just for the radio checkboxes.

141
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,480
You could do that as well.

142
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,320
We still have a handle click.

143
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,870
So I'm going to copy the handle.

144
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,710
I'm going to go right here and paste it.

145
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:25,120
What else we do have a handle angle so and copy and paste it like it's all before you could just create

146
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:32,960
a single component check for the collapsable and inside maybe create a different component here here.

147
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,100
And you know maybe in the list and show a different list with checkboxes and the radio we could totally

148
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,050
do that.

149
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,910
So we have the handle angle and see what else we get and that's it.

150
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,910
That's it for now.

151
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,490
Everything else like the rental list and handle Tuggle.

152
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,430
This is going to be a little bit different from now on.

153
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,150
So I'm going to go again to collapse checkbox and I'm going to copy the complete list from the list

154
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,590
the way up for this and I'm going to paste it down here.

155
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,570
Of course we need to change some few things.

156
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,900
So we still have a list with the board there bottom right.

157
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,380
Remind me tomorrow man.

158
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,230
So we have a list item.

159
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,480
Again we triggered on the handle click and again we have a list text which is the title and the handle

160
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,470
angle that stays the same.

161
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,480
The class is still a collapse time at outgo an amount on it.

162
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,880
Same same idea.

163
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,570
We still have a list inside.

164
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,010
But what's going to change is what we get inside the list.

165
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,970
Right.

166
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:42,910
So if now I just put whatever doesn't matter when I put an and we go to our component and we make this

167
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,470
a little bit smaller.

168
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:52,640
I go to Price I toggle and works and notice that on the render we get it open because that was what

169
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,410
we passed.

170
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,830
That's a property right here.

171
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,570
Initial State.

172
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,470
Get.

173
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,560
So now we need to create the radio.

174
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,960
And for this one.

175
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,880
Remember that the radio we can get only one value so all the radios are pretty much you know into one

176
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,560
right they are all related.

177
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,630
That's why radios work.

178
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,910
So first we need to use that radio group.

179
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,560
We've imported the top so radio group and opening close.

180
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,030
Now we need to pass some properties here some default properties.

181
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,890
We need the area label and this one is going to be prices this is just from material.

182
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:37,320
Then we need to pass a name so the name is going to be priceless right.

183
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,110
And then we need to pass a value whenever we check something inside of here different radios.

184
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,360
They bailed Baalu is going to be the same.

185
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:52,750
So value bound you equals to whatever we have inside this that state that value.

186
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,230
And then of course we need to handle the change just like what they did with the arm with the checkbox.

187
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:07,610
So we need to pass the on change and the change is going to be this not handle angle no handle change.

188
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,400
We don't have this function of course we will add it going at it right now and then of course we cannot

189
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,270
complete this will change just a function open to close.

190
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,280
OK.

191
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,870
So inside of here will have a list.

192
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,000
This is what we can do right now.

193
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm going to say this render and then list opening close.

194
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,970
Now let's go to this function right here.

195
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm going to put it on the top of handle change.

196
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,270
So this render list is going to be a function that at the end is going to be returning something.

197
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,380
And what we will we will be returning is some GSX so parenthesis.

198
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,960
So first we need to enter to this that props up list and make sure we have a list to render if we don't

199
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,030
we don't do anything.

200
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,100
Then of course we need to loop.

201
00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:00,530
This prompts the list and then we do a map just like we did with check boxes and on each iteration we

202
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,510
will get a value.

203
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,450
And remember if you have one there's no need to do this.

204
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,530
It just can do it like this.

205
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,810
And of course again we still want to render some GSX so parenthesis.

206
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,660
Now what are we going to be using to render the radios.

207
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,160
Is the form control level.

208
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,520
That's why we brought it up top.

209
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,470
So inside of this we will return this form control label.

210
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,060
Right.

211
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,670
Can open and close.

212
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,210
Now of course this form control label needs a lot of properties so I'm going to go right here.

213
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,350
The first thing is is the key.

214
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:40,110
So we going to be passing the value underscore ID as a key then we need a value.

215
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
The value is going to be equal to whatever we get.

216
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,160
And again I'm going to be passing strings on a string if not going to get an error.

217
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,330
So I'm going to be pozna again banlieue underscore ID.

218
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,090
All right.

219
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,590
That we need the actual control and the actual control.

220
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,220
It's what it's going to be rendered at the end.

221
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,680
So control equals to what and it's going to be the radio.

222
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,590
That's why you're bringing this at the top.

223
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,730
And it's the only one that it's not used.

224
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,500
So radio control is going to be past this.

225
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,180
Of course is a component because it is a component and then of course we need to use the label label

226
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,770
open in close value that name that is ZID.

227
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,420
So let's see what we get.

228
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,930
If you go to our Ok we are rendering everything that is good.

229
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,610
But we are getting a failed pop typing ballot prop numbers supplied to where you're OK.

230
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:40,100
So if I go to read your group or here I'm sitting at this that state that values so we need to pass

231
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,340
trng right here.

232
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,280
We cannot use a number.

233
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,340
This is how this works.

234
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,290
So they're passing a value of a number.

235
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,040
So what I do I just changed it to a string.

236
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,110
As a matter right now so the application will reload.

237
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,740
No error anywhere.

238
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,650
That is good.

239
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,300
So we have any zero and everything else of course.

240
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,530
Everything works OK.

241
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:10,920
Now what we need to do we need to do next is we need to do the handle change because if we go right

242
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,390
here we are saying that every time we do something we do they handle change.

243
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,300
We have this function but it's not doing anything.

244
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
So what do we do.

245
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,360
And the thing that we need to do is to grab the value right here.

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,010
We got the value from the radio group and we said at this stage that value and that is it.

247
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:37,380
So I'm going to go to the handle change and say this that said state opening close and now the value

248
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,460
is equal to what whenever we do the unchanged.

249
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:48,920
This one will be passing an event and the event contains the idea of whatever we are selecting.

250
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,510
So we going to catch that event right here and you could do it like this.

251
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:03,760
You know we have a single argument and the value is equal to event that target that value that is at.

252
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,050
Let's right again or I.

253
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,930
So if I select 300 we get it we get it and everything is good.

254
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,810
All right.

255
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,620
So now inside of the state of course we're getting the value of whatever we are selecting right.

256
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,120
And that is good but of course this is happening inside this component.

257
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,010
And I want to delete this I forgot to let this sorry goodbye.

258
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:37,530
So we need to go to the grab the value of whatever we are doing and go to the parent component to the

259
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,750
handle filters and pass the value.

260
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,410
All right.

261
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:49,410
So I'm going to go here and say this that props that handle and I believe it called handle filters handle

262
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,210
filters handle filters.

263
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,150
Open and close and we pass whatever we get inside the valley so event the target value target.

264
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,170
All right so this component it's pretty much done.

265
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,030
There's nothing else we need to do right now.

266
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,010
Now what we need to do we need to go to the parent component and check what is happening inside this

267
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:15,120
filters because now inside the handle filters whenever we go to this function with the price we are

268
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,790
saying OK we want to put something inside the filters with just one boom value.

269
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:29,400
And if you remember the value it's not the actual array the value is the number it's 1 0 or the idea

270
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,220
of whatever we are looking right here.

271
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,110
So it's 5 1 0 and you know and that.

272
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,860
So we can i need to fix that.

273
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,660
OK.

274
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,050
So let's go to back to index and we're going to go to handle filter's.

275
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:50,670
So what we need to do now is go to this fixed prices find the ID of I don't know maybe zero we have

276
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,780
zero value.

277
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,770
We go to zero and we know that is nothing.

278
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,970
So the array will be empty.

279
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,660
If you have three we go and the array with this one.

280
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:05,160
So what we need to do is you know go to that bring it and then merge it with what we have right here

281
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,380
on the filters.

282
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:16,950
So I going to say I'm going to make space I'm going to say if opening close category category yes equal

283
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,950
triple equals price.

284
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,140
Remember we are passing the category right here.

285
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,410
What are we going to do.

286
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:32,970
We cannot let price values in and say create a barbell and say this dad handle price you're going to

287
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,230
do this in a minute.

288
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,260
Of course we don't have this function and handle price is going to be equals to the filters which is

289
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,700
going to be the value of the ID.

290
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,840
No one two three four five and once we get this from this function we're going to create it.

291
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,790
Right now we're going to enter new filters and we're going to say again pretty much the same with it

292
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,760
before new filters.

293
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,510
Category equals then prize values.

294
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,640
All right.

295
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,500
Now of course we don't have this handle price could be handle prices no matter how the price is going

296
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
to go right here and say handle price.

297
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:19,140
So like I told before we need to go to the array of the initial prices array of objects find Yadi and

298
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:26,910
bring the value which is the rate so going to say concert data equal price that we have a top price

299
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,530
target.

300
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,640
So once we do that I'm going to create an empty array so array it equal to nothing.

301
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:42,270
Then of course I'm going to do a good old for a loop so let key in data.

302
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,750
So once we do this what we need to do.

303
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,020
OK.

304
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:51,340
If we can find the same key or inside data which is the prizes of Ray I want to bring it and stored

305
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:58,920
inside a rate so data we grab the key and we access the idea.

306
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,800
All right.

307
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:06,400
And that is equal to 1 2 3 and are going to convert everything to number because we are actually using

308
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,840
numbers and whenever we come from filters we are getting a string.

309
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:18,910
So I need to do Par's and open it close and we do value coma and we need to use the 10 because if not

310
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,140
begin to get an error message.

311
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,080
All right.

312
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,800
That is get some insight if you're going to enter the array.

313
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,790
I'm going to say whatever.

314
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,570
If we find this of course whatever we have inside of here are going to make it equal to that array.

315
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,900
So we say data and key and we're just going to copy this dot and I'm going to bring the array value

316
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,250
remember that here we have the array.

317
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:48,030
So whenever we find a match we grab whatever we have inside the array and we set it equal to a rate.

318
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,240
And at the very very end I'm going to say return rate.

319
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,890
So the result of this the values is going to be that a rate that matches the ID right.

320
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,270
That of course we added to the categories of prices.

321
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,080
In theory this could should be working.

322
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm getting an error with banlieue.

323
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,500
Maybe I made a mistake right here.

324
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,510
I'm not passing of course the value.

325
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,190
Right.

326
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,420
The value we get from this handle the price.

327
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,810
All right.

328
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,100
So let's check it out.

329
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,970
If I click it we get something else.

330
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,400
And now notice that we have a price with an array of the 300 to 5 9:9.

331
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,240
If I change it we get 0 2 2 9 9.

332
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,540
If I select all four brands we are still getting it right.

333
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,390
So now we have pretty much all the logic we need right here to make a request to the server and send

334
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,180
this this on as a Jason.

335
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:45,630
Right.

336
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,600
So we can catch it on the server of course on the next section we're going to do the request.

337
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,410
We can use redox forced to do the request and we need to go to server and create I'm proud because we

338
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,420
don't have it.

339
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,490
So let's go to the next one and start with that.

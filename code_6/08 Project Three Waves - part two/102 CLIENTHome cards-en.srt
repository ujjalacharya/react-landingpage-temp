1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,890
All right so now we're going to do this because it fetched the new arrivals.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,230
And again we're going to go and get the best selling guitars we've already have.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,190
Have a route that can handle this kind of request so you know that is covered.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,380
So the only thing we need to do is to go to the index which is home create connect redux right here.

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,280
We need to go to read x set up the products action created types and then they create the reduce or

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,640
so we need to do a lot of setup first before we can you know make the request.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,450
So let's start with redux.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm going to go to actions and create a new new file called products actions that jackass.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,700
So inside of a person's actions first we need to import axially.

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,510
And I don't want to type it.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,370
I'm going to copy right here.

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,740
I'm going to paste it right here.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,550
I copied it from user actions.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,950
Of course these types are not really right.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,800
Begin to use other types.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:06,610
Now if you remember we are importing the route from the from Maersk so I'm going to copy that as well.

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,580
And I'm going to go back to Misc. because the Barville it's different.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,810
We need things from the product server which is API and the product.

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,540
OK.

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,330
So product server.

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:17,890
All right.

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,840
That is good.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,610
Now we will create two different functions begin to make two request.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,660
We could create just one options one on one function right here and get all the things byte ID arguments.

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,650
But uncreate I'm going to create two.

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,560
So because this project again is going to go to you at the end maybe in a few months you will not remember

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,450
what this function is all about.

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,340
So by creating a function that says get product by a rival and then get products by sell.

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,770
It's kind of obvious.

30
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,460
So that's why I'm reading this like this.

31
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,170
All right.

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:02:02,260
So I'm going to export a function get called Get products by and then a rival.

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,420
This is the first one just a function.

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:14,280
Then we have export function and then get and I get a copy the one at the bottom get products buy sell.

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:14,810
All right.

36
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,630
Open and Close.

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,710
Of course this ones will be using two different types.

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,780
So I'm going to go here and change the type.

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:32,440
So get products buy sell and same thing with this one but this one is going to be arrival's So now we

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,230
have the import for the types of course we need to go to types and at them there.

41
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,510
So I'm going to pace them both.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,350
I'm going to copy the export Konst and do them both.

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:56,920
All right of course on this one we need to type we can at present so get get them products buy and then

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
sell.

45
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,110
Right.

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,270
This is done.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:08,670
Next one equals and then get products by a rival.

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,480
Right.

49
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,030
One last thing to do.

50
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,640
OK.

51
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,200
So now we need to create a reducer.

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,370
We don't have a we do so for products.

53
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,780
So I'm going to go to reducers.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:28,380
I'm going to create a new file and say products could be product but you know and then reducer that

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,340
Japs are going to go to use a reducer copy everything pretty much and then I'm going to close it and

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,650
go to the product reduce or going to delete the types we need to import this types.

57
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,630
You know these are the product types.

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,730
And then of course I'm going to delete everything right here.

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,550
The first one that we're going to be creating is the get products buy sell.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,580
So if the case is that we get products buy sell we can return.

61
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,360
And for now we can just return dot dot dot and the state and they're going to do the same thing for

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,840
the other one.

63
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,200
So pretty much we are leaving everything ready to perform the request you know from that action.

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,680
All right.

65
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,830
So now we have the products reducer.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
We have the types and we have the products auction.

67
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,190
So now auction.

68
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:21,850
So now the only thing we need to do is to go to next right go to index and include redux right here.

69
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:39,900
So first I'm going to import then connect connect and all right connect from re-act redux react redux.

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,010
All right.

71
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,560
What's next.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,210
Next thing we need to import the functions you know the functions where we're going to be dispatching

73
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,930
things.

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,990
So it's going to get products by cell coma and the other one gets products by a rival.

75
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,750
So our rival.

76
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,590
So in real life of course right now I'm creating the project with ubat in real life.

77
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:07,540
I just do this do multiple things before I need to use them and then I use it.

78
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,600
I believe you know most of us we we pretty much all up all we've got the developers they do the same

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,820
thing right.

80
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,050
So we need to go to connect connect open and close and then we wrap home.

81
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,250
All right.

82
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:28,090
So after we get the products we're going to do a component amount after we get the Prada products we're

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,770
going to inject the products inside of here with the props.

84
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,730
So we will make a reference to a new component and we will pass the product the Propst with all the

85
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,490
products.

86
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,390
All right.

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,370
So we need map state to.

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,590
Now on the previous lectures.

89
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,080
I was doing function substate to Propst.

90
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,630
You can still do Kunst.

91
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:54,770
You know let me do we have a complete map state of prop's you can do it like this cons upstate to prompts.

92
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,750
So it's pretty much same thing but just with iOS 6.

93
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,070
So now on the Propp we do have a user I'm sorry a product reducer right.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,170
We have the file help fight right here.

95
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,800
The only thing that we don't have is import inside of the producer.

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,610
We are not combining that reducer.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,820
So import products from that forward slash products reducer.

98
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,560
All right.

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,660
We're going to put a coma and I'm going to bring it and close it because we don't need it anymore.

100
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,670
So it's going to be products.

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,750
It will be called products.

102
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,760
Sorry I closed it.

103
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,310
They closed this and I actually needed it because they don't remember.

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,000
Sometimes they have bad memory.

105
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,860
So products.

106
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,120
I was right there and then we of course passed the state products and we need to make a reference to

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,870
the maps with the maps the props inside of that connect.

108
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,760
All right.

109
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,770
So far so good.

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,370
So let's let's try to make a request you know dispatch does get products by cell.

111
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,540
And of course we need to add the request right here.

112
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,500
But let's first try to dispatch this component at Mt..

113
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:12,060
Open opening close and we go to this that props that this patch opening close and we get the products

114
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,390
by cell.

115
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,560
All right.

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,850
So of course we are not doing anything inside of our components.

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,680
That's why we get an error because we are not returning anything right here.

118
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,610
OK.

119
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,440
If you remember.

120
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,700
We need to get this from the server and right here we do have all the information.

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,450
So first we're going to get the buy sell right buy sell so buy sell.

122
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:44,450
It's this it's sold by something or they're descending or ascending depending on what we want to do.

123
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,930
And then we go in and do this the limit I'm going to skip are going to copy this one from here.

124
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,970
And remember that the request to forward slash and then articles.

125
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:01,300
So going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to paste this just to have a reference.

126
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,840
So products buy sell at cost request equals CEOs that get opening close.

127
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,390
And then when we need to make a reference to the server so template strings and we make a reference

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,880
to the server and it's inside articles.

129
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,940
So what we want to do we need to do this sort by.

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,060
So we do the question and let me close this so we can see pretty much all that's just going to paste

131
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,150
it.

132
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,290
Copy and paste it.

133
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,460
It's OK.

134
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:38,550
So on the buy sell we get to sort by everything sort everything by sold then the or there descending

135
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,700
just like we did before.

136
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,550
And we're going to limit 100.

137
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,190
Not really.

138
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,540
We just want to get four.

139
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,520
So I'm going to say four right.

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:54,350
So after this Zygons request we're going to get the proneness so open and close we will get a response.

141
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,480
And from the response we get the response that data.

142
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,900
All right.

143
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,910
And of course and this is why we're getting an error message.

144
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,120
It's because we are not returning anything from redux.

145
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,020
We need to return something.

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:17,370
So type at it's get products sell coma than payload and it's whatever we get back from the request and

147
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,160
then go to request.

148
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,940
All right.

149
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,070
I made a change to the server.

150
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,990
They are going to say so.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,890
OK so now get products buy sell.

152
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,140
We are doing the request.

153
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,910
So now we need to go to the actual reducer.

154
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,090
So let's go to products we.

155
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:40,830
So in products reduce or we to get the elements so we can store them buy sell open opening close and

156
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:49,960
then action that payload not open and close is just Conn's com PELAYO.

157
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,850
There we go.

158
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,430
All right.

159
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,450
So then it's not defined.

160
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,830
All right this is my mistake.

161
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,120
Forgot to put that thought.

162
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,810
All right.

163
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,380
OK.

164
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,770
So at least of these is not you know breaking.

165
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,900
So if we go to the stake right here let's see what happens.

166
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,110
Right.

167
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,400
So we go to state and we get the users of course.

168
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,490
And then we get products and we get buy sell and I'm getting a 404.

169
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,720
All right let's see we see the actual message.

170
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,510
So product not found secret policy.

171
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,990
I'm pretty sure I made a mistake with the actual route.

172
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,640
So it's articles articles.

173
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,810
There we go.

174
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,940
Sorry all right state and to get it get it.

175
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,220
So pro-CPS buy sell and we get four different elements.

176
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,190
So Goodman your work is really good.

177
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:57,340
So let's do the VI arrival since it's so easy so easy going to go and set said the get parts my arrival.

178
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,170
Then inside actions we pretty much need to do the same exact thing.

179
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:11,730
So like a all before it makes a little bit more sense to create one one only one dispatches one where

180
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,190
we can pass all the options disruptions inside in inside of arguments.

181
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,020
You know we pass them by using arguments and right here we just make two different requests with different

182
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,100
arguments.

183
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,800
Right.

184
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,080
OK.

185
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,070
So I'm going to copy this.

186
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,590
I don't want to type it again.

187
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,590
I'm going to copy and I'm going to paste.

188
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,380
Of course we need to change some things that make us right.

189
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,060
All right.

190
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,280
So we're still going to articles now this sort by is going to be bye.

191
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,260
And let's go to the server and check it out.

192
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,670
My arrival is going to be created at the time stamp that Mongo it's creating for us.

193
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,680
Then the order is going to be still the sending and the limit for the only changes they created.

194
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,230
All right.

195
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,500
So we are getting the arrival so we need to go to the product for douceur and it will that we will really

196
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,910
have the type there.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,510
OK.

198
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:16,200
So now of course instead of by cell we get by a rival by our rival and this one will be getting the

199
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,520
action that payload.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,850
All right let's reload the application and see what we get.

201
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,650
So actions state we go to products and we have a buy sell and we don't have a bio rival.

202
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,010
That's kind of weird.

203
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,960
Products by cell I made a mistake with this.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,020
No my arrival.

205
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,160
Fine.

206
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,670
Oh it's because I'm using the same type of course of course.

207
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,120
All right let's try again.

208
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,580
State opening close and we get buy sell and buy a rival get.

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,300
OK.

210
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,190
So now what we need to do and we're going to do it of course in the Knesset next section we have a buy

211
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:04,150
sell and buy a rival so we will need to create right here a component that will take the four elements

212
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:10,140
in device cell and another one right here the bottom that takes the four elements of the by arrival

213
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,630
and of course we need to create a different component that it's going to be rendering carts why a different

214
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,440
component.

215
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,910
And it's because right here we have a cart that we have to begin to get one component rendering the

216
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,860
four carts and then for each we have a cart.

217
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,820
If we go to guitars we pretty much have the same cart.

218
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,170
So this one should be reusable components right.

219
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,900
All right.

220
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,490
So let's go to the next section and create the carts.

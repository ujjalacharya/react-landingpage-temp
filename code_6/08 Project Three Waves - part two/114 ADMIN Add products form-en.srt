1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,580
OK so let's bring the imports.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,110
We need the user layouts.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:15,850
So user layout user layouts and with a capital L and it's from of course you tell us I'm sorry the H.O.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,050
sees that for Slashdot for us.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,690
Last one more and H.O. see forward slash and the user.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,700
All right.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,270
And of course we can wrap everything inside of this user layout well and we just do it now so we can

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,030
get something at least on the screen.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
Because right now it's not really we actually.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,010
All right.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,030
So you know we get our product and then decide that right.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,580
So we need to import a lot of more things we need to form fields remember.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,710
So I'm going to say important.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,510
And actually we can we can just save time right here.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:02,050
Remember that we have some form fields on other parts of the application maybe we have the other log

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,020
in of course or the register.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,240
So if you go to we're just log in and then you go to register you have it right here.

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,240
So I'm going to copy this because we can really use it.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,230
So I'm going to add products and paste it.

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,920
Of course they are not on the same place.

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:25,370
There are going to be inside one more data that forward slash and I'm going to do it right here.

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,770
One two or three up and there we go.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,230
So then we of course would need to import connect import connect because we're going to be dispatching

24
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,290
actions of course.

25
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,590
And remember that we are entering products and they need woods and they need brands.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,590
So we need to import the list of brands.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,830
So I'm going to say good brand remember that this is the name of the function.

28
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:58,520
I'm going to just double check it going to go to actions product actions and we have the category which

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,580
is get brands.

30
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,920
Right.

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,170
So that's one that when he's done and then we have to get woods so so get puts coma and we're going

32
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,520
to have a one more.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,650
But we're going to do it at the end.

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:15,020
It's going to be the dead dispatch of actually publishing you know storing everything on the database.

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,630
So we go to actions and that product actions right.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,130
We are always done right here at the top.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,310
Of course we need to we have connect we need to operate the components.

38
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:34,430
So connect open and close and begin to add the product.

39
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,020
All right.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,000
We're going to do my Up-State props.

41
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,910
We could use it.

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:46,130
So I'm going to say map state to prop's own prompts and we're going to use the products and then we

43
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,640
bring state products and begin to put it right here.

44
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,500
All right.

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,160
So pretty much done everything that we need to import.

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,320
Now the first thing of course it's the state of the forum right.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,090
We need to do a lot of things right here.

48
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,810
So we're going to go to the top and say state opening close.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
So we have the form error.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,210
So this one will be false at the beginning.

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:21,280
Then we have the form success you know form success and then again it's false coma.

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,180
And then we have our form data right.

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,510
So the form data will have many many things.

54
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:37,760
Ryan will have a name and are going to go again to register and copy the name because they are very

55
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,010
very similar if not the same.

56
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,090
So we still have an input.

57
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,200
We do have a value right.

58
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,350
We have a name a type and a placeholder.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,670
And if you remember maybe on the previous project with the label thing.

60
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,990
So we're going to do it right now.

61
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:02,470
Again we're going to still do this so we can add a label and we're going to say product name right.

62
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,400
I don't remember we added this but if we don't we don't have it we can add it just very simple anyways.

63
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,930
So we have we still have ballot touch validation message.

64
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,330
And remember that to show the label we need one more prop which is show label.

65
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,250
And this one will be set true because we want to show the label.

66
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,170
Okay.

67
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,440
We have more things going to copy name go at the bottom.

68
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,360
And this one is going to be the description.

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:40,580
So this Christian Right and this one will be a text area so text area and this one product description.

70
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,700
The this one description input Yeah.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,620
All right.

72
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,790
It's going to be just Stillwell type text does matter.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:58,640
And then add your description validation is going to be required Matt it is still touch and show level

74
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,650
will be true.

75
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,400
All right.

76
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm going to copy the one that has the name.

77
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,460
So we're going to copy the name and I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to close

78
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,230
this because they bother me right now.

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,150
So this one will be the price.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,780
What is the price of the guitar.

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,240
So input product price and then price.

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,610
All right then the type is going to be number right.

83
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,330
And you can do this on your own.

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,730
Right.

85
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,590
And the price then valid.

86
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,680
Everything is the same and show Leavell true.

87
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,280
All right then we have a brand and right here we have a different element.

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,430
So with the brand just like this instead of unempowered it's going to be a select begin to load all

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,500
the brands right here.

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,550
So this one will be a select.

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,650
We don't have a select.

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,960
We're going to create it in a couple of minutes.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,550
So brand and then brand input right.

94
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,000
That type is going to be whatever Actually we don't need a tiebreak here.

95
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,760
And the placeholder we don't really need a placeholder.

96
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,080
So there we go.

97
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,170
OK.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,890
So now what we need in this one is going to be the options.

99
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:18,890
So the options is going to start as an empty array but much later we going to fetch the brands and then

100
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,930
we're going to inject the brand so we can pretty much update the state of options inside brand.

101
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,860
All right.

102
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,710
The validation is still required.

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,470
Show level 2 everything else.

104
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,420
It's just the same.

105
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,640
Now I'm going to copy the brand.

106
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,500
We go right here at the bottom and then we have the I have the shipping.

107
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,330
So the shipping it's pretty simple.

108
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,370
We don't need to load information inside of the options.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,740
We can just add it right here.

110
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,820
So I'm going to say shipping this is still select and it's product shipping or could be just shipping

111
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:01,020
right and then shipping impot now options are going at it right here.

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
We're going to open it close.

113
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
And if you remember we have a key a coma and then we have a value right.

114
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,110
This is what we used in the previous project where we're going to do the same thing right here.

115
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,270
So we have a key and a value of.

116
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,510
Yes.

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:24,450
And unmangled it goes we are using of course the true false type of Moul you know we're using booleans.

118
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,200
So this one is going to be false and this one no.

119
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,380
All right everything good the still required.

120
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,360
And we will show the label.

121
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,690
All right.

122
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,960
Next.

123
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,250
So the next one is going to be if it's available or not.

124
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,420
So I'm going to go right here and the available key is going to him is going to.

125
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,920
Right now we are not really using it on the products but when we go to the.

126
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,750
Let me just go right here.

127
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,020
Well of course we are doing it when we go right here and we go to the product.

128
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,970
It says Free Shipping and Return and none available preorder only.

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:09,010
So you know just that detail is something that you might have on real life of a level we call it available.

130
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,290
We're going to check later anyways.

131
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:20,060
So it's a small select and available and it's dark and of course this one will be available to copy

132
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,310
from here and paste it here.

133
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,790
And again this one will be the same key.

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,990
True false yes no.

135
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,030
Right.

136
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,810
It's a validation.

137
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,790
Everything else is just the same.

138
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,710
Then we have the wood and the wood again.

139
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,160
It's just like this.

140
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,410
I'm going to copy and paste it.

141
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,050
I'm going to say a word.

142
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,540
So I still select and then word material.

143
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,110
Now this one actually is kind of a fake with guitars.

144
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,090
I'm not sure if I told you already of this guitar guitars you might have.

145
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,480
Of course any time which one word that could happen.

146
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:03,190
But most of the times that guitar guitars are made of different words sometimes most of the times.

147
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:03,610
Could have.

148
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,260
You could get a guitar completely made in mahogany for example.

149
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,870
I get it.

150
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,950
Meanwhile do this in mahogany but most of the times you just get a guitar.

151
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,610
And of course we will load the words from the server so we can leave this empty.

152
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,790
You're going to get a guitar with a buddy of basswood and a neck of mahogany or something like that.

153
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,630
You know most of the times you get a mix.

154
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,720
So next one it's the frets.

155
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,940
Now with the frets we pretty much have another select but this one we just need to fix.

156
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,270
Put the hard coded information right here.

157
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,950
You are not going to load everything from the server because we just have about three four options.

158
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,160
It's really simple.

159
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:53,410
So this one will be Fretz And of course instead of wood it's going to be Fretz and we are almost done.

160
00:09:53,420 --> 00:10:01,280
We are almost done and we are using the key value person going to copy this and paste it right here

161
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,190
and say a key of number in this case.

162
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,240
So we have 21 Fretz which is very uncommon.

163
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,770
We have 22 Freda's 22 frets.

164
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,870
And then we have 24 guitars with 23 frets that doesn't exist.

165
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:30,350
So 20 and 20 Why 24 frets is the longest because it's two octaves.

166
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,010
That's it.

167
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,750
That's really why so OCHA.

168
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,990
So we have Fretz select frets frets and put everything else.

169
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,460
It's just the same right.

170
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,170
And the last actually we have two more but we are not going to do the last one because it's the images.

171
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,070
I mean going to do that at the end is the public the public option.

172
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,970
So I'm going to copy the one that's available because we have a yes no value.

173
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,160
So we're going to paste it here and say publish.

174
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,360
Remember this one.

175
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,390
This is the one we use to show the product or not are not to common users.

176
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,170
So publish and then publish then the key is still true false.

177
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,150
But we can say instead of yes we can say public and then hidden.

178
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,660
All right.

179
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,440
Still the show labels just same everything else the same.

180
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,750
A lot of things.

181
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,750
All right.

182
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:34,350
So let's let's include the form fields right here for all of this feels write so let's do the form fields

183
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,940
and I made a mistake right here at the top.

184
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,980
Maybe you noticed and I didn't.

185
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,490
So it's re-act redux.

186
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,390
That's why nothing is working right here.

187
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,510
So let's of course reload and we should be getting something at least.

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,830
OK.

189
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,940
So that is good.

190
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,430
Again just like with the Before we go we're here we don't need it.

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,240
And you know that this exists at this point this is this should be very very familiar to you.

192
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,390
So I'm going to close it because you know it's a lot of information and I don't like it.

193
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,310
So I'm going to go inside.

194
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,110
We're of course going to delete everything.

195
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,960
I'm going to put a wrapper div and inside just an 8 one stack the form it's not really that complicated

196
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,400
it's real simple.

197
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,070
That was what I did it this way on purpose.

198
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,990
You know so we can spend less time doing layouts.

199
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,120
So we have a form we have an ounce of met just like before.

200
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,100
So the answer met again.

201
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,760
We open and close.

202
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,540
We pass the event.

203
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,710
So just like this.

204
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:44,550
And then we just create a function that calls the submit forms of meant submit and then form right.

205
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,100
Then of course we pass the event.

206
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,430
Same same same as always.

207
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,190
All right.

208
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,660
So now instead of here we just start adding inputs.

209
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,490
So I'm going to go to predict actions.

210
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,870
No I'm going to go to register and I'm going to copy one of the form fields so we don't have to type

211
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,210
type it again.

212
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm going to copy the form name on it.

213
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm going to go to for Maime paste right.

214
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,350
Let me do this first form of selection.

215
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,150
All right.

216
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,490
So OK so the form fields just in this case it's just a name right.

217
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,220
Just like this.

218
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,800
Name form date a name and then the element.

219
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,900
So that one we are get later right here at the top right here.

220
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,550
We will be adding the image file a file upload.

221
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,990
But for now this is good.

222
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,590
OK.

223
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,850
So right from the start we have a problem.

224
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,880
We didn't have.

225
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,490
And let me just do the log in

226
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,520
right from the start.

227
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,710
We didn't have the attack names so we need to add them right.

228
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,340
OK.

229
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:54,130
So if you remember this it's inside you tells form form fields right here.

230
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,350
So we need to start adding the the tax form here and then the next section maybe I'm not I'm not sure

231
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,440
we're going to do it right now but on the next section we need to add all the select and the text area.

232
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,620
Remember that now we have a select and we have a text area.

233
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,290
So we need to use them.

234
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,420
So I'm going to go to below the foreign block opening close and going to say okay if we have a form

235
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:24,880
data that show a label on here not a capital L label then of course we want to display something if

236
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,710
not no.

237
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:34,270
So what we do we just pass a div with a class the class name it's called to label inputs.

238
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:42,640
And inside we would just put the form data so form data that config dot whatever we are passing to the

239
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,820
label.

240
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,960
So we load it.

241
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,350
Oh sorry.

242
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,790
There's one problem with this.

243
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,630
And the store is just keep logging me out.

244
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,480
That's OK.

245
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,800
So we have the password one two three.

246
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:58,750
OK.

247
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,620
That is get so we get we get the tag.

248
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,500
So all right.

249
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,490
So that works.

250
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,790
So OK so let's keep keep moving forward.

251
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,010
We do have a select ride.

252
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,780
So let's do the select right now.

253
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,910
I don't know if we have time.

254
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,510
Now it's already too long so let's go to the next section and begin at the select and the text area.

1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,430
All right so now we're going to do the file upload.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,520
So for the file upload first we're going to use a service we're going to use cloud Inari.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,930
You can go to Carbonari create an account and everything else.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,970
And once you're in go to the dashboard and or the dashboard the first thing you can see is the account

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,140
details with the cloud name API.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,260
An API secret.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,530
We will use this in a couple minutes and then at the bottom you have other plans.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,220
We are on the free plan and they give you you know a lot of starch.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,050
And if you want to change to a more professional you can use this and you can contact cloud Narey and

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,310
tell them what you really need because the plus plan it's pretty big.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,810
Two million images maybe you don't need that.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,700
You can contact them and they will give you a new plan.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,020
More and of course cheaper plan.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,070
OK.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,280
Let's get.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,400
So go to Clarie create an account.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,210
Go back to our project.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,830
So this is what's going happen.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,500
Right now we are just posting data into our database.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,370
Right.

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,060
So what we're going to do it's not to upload at the same time we posted data.

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,490
We will do the file upload.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,790
We will upload images and get the image.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,950
Your help once we get we get the image your l.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,950
Then of course we enter more information.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,970
And what we will be posting is the image you are L..

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,370
We are not doing the upload while we are posting the whole product.

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,920
All right.

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,650
So for this we going to create a new component.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,970
So let's do that.

31
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,420
It's going to go right here at the top are going to import and I'm going to call it file upload file

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,100
upload from that for Slash and I'm going to host it inside you Tilse.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,380
Let me do that first.

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,090
Inside details and forms.

35
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,900
I'm going to call it file upload just like this.

36
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,590
Ass could go back here.

37
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:51,140
And from dot dot for Slashdot that forward slash you tells We go to form forward slash and file upload.

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,740
All right now since we are not going to do the upload from within this component we're going to do the

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,480
upload from within file upload file upload upload something.

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,090
It's going to return to the parent component which is this one the Eurail or the images that we are

41
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,310
just uploading.

42
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,370
So we need to store them inside of the form fields.

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,320
So whenever we send this to the server the images will be there.

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,630
Right.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,030
That is the idea.

46
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,650
Kind of pretty much did this already on the second project.

47
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,920
So we need to create a place where we can be hosting the images just like this.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,930
So we're going to do coma.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,750
I'm going to say images opening close and we pass an object of the rules.

50
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,120
They need to follow the same rules right here.

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,420
So what we will do we will out of value just like this value and value an empty array.

52
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,640
We need validation because we can go through validation.

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,890
But on this one they're required which is the only validation we get is going to be false.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,320
Remember that the image and the images are not required that we have the ballot the touch the validation

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,650
message and then we could get the show Leavell.

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,310
But you're not going to really use it.

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,810
So I'm going to copy paste and the valid will be true because they are not required to Targett still

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,150
false no validation message.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,010
And the show label is going to be false.

60
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,440
We're not going to use it.

61
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,720
And that is that whenever we upload something it's going to go through here.

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,740
So let's go at the bottom and let's add the form field which is not a form filled.

63
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,170
Now it's going to be called file upload.

64
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,800
So I'm going to just make a reference to that component.

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
And we need to pass some props.

66
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,540
Now the prompts that we need to add are just to the image handler images and then handler.

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,520
And this one will be a function whenever we upload something to file upload it will return something.

68
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,360
So we are going to catch it.

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:56,200
And then of course whenever we catch it we run different function called Images handler.

70
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,450
And I believe I forgot to delete it because I was just testing.

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,910
So maybe we have that function yet we do have it.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,470
Don't worry we just create a function to avoid any errors.

73
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:14,110
Then whenever we upload something of course we're going to reset the form and we need to reset the images

74
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,810
as well.

75
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:21,660
So we said reset open it close and I'm going to be passing this state that form success.

76
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't worry we will get back to this later.

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,480
All right.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,090
So let's go to the file upload and start doing all of this.

79
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,510
So this is a re-act class based component and I'm going to change the capital F and that's it.

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,300
Now for the file upload we will use a third party library called dropzone re-act drop zone.

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,250
So let we find it drub soon.

82
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,630
So there we go reargue dropzone.

83
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,570
And this is a very simple very very simple.

84
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,500
You have all the documentation right here and right here at the top documentation and examples.

85
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,780
If you go there and of course you get pretty much the same thing and you get you get all the prompts

86
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,590
and a basic example.

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm going to try to use the same example they are giving us because again you might be reading the instructions

88
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,790
in the future.

89
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,080
So if I teach you or show you on the same way it's a little bit simpler.

90
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,130
So this is what Johnson as we just get square.

91
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,610
And if we drop something or we click something we just get the file upload and after we upload it you

92
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,250
know it's going to go right here.

93
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:39,700
So this is what we get whenever we drop or we do something we upload something drop on drop method drop

94
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,600
and we pass the files.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
So whenever we get on drop we going to do that requests to our server and stored images enclaves in

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,870
very very simple that that's good.

97
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,840
So let's go back to our project and start with this.

98
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,500
We will need a few things.

99
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,070
So import import.

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,490
And first we need dropzone and we've already installed it.

101
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,710
So if you check it under dependencies you can and you can see it there.

102
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,100
Jubb zone right.

103
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,020
The next thing it's important.

104
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,320
The board actually knows I'm not going to go through a redux.

105
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:22,660
I'm just going to use the NEC network request from here a little bit simpler than we need.

106
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,460
Awesome.

107
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,530
So import phones.

108
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,030
Awesome.

109
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,530
Oh and it's fun.

110
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,120
Awesome icon from that weird forward.

111
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,960
Awesome.

112
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,210
And react for it.

113
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,240
Awesome or phantasm.

114
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,580
Now the icons we need is just one icon.

115
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,710
It's a plus.

116
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,430
And then circle from.

117
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,800
And now we need the fort.

118
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,920
Awesome but it's going to be free solid.

119
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,800
All right.

120
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,830
Forget.

121
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,080
We need one more thing.

122
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:04,890
I'm going to import a circular and then progress from you guessed it material.

123
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,400
I this is the last of the imports.

124
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:14,650
So add material I core and that which is being circular or progress.

125
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,820
Good.

126
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,270
You're done with the imports.

127
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,830
If you check the example on dropzone they're using a constructor.

128
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:29,620
So let me just do this constructor open and close we do we pass the super and then we say this that

129
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,100
state this is exampled that they are giving us right now of course this is a template they give us the

130
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:41,620
Cubas but you can do something like state on this new version of react.

131
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,830
We just can do state inside state will be handled by reactive backgrounds and it's the same thing than

132
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,260
doing this all right.

133
00:07:50,660 --> 00:08:00,230
So once we are inside the state we need two states the app loaded just like this and then files with

134
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,910
a capital F files which is going to be starting as an array and empty.

135
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,510
Right.

136
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,090
And then we have to get a different property called uploading which is false.

137
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,380
And this this property is going to be like if we are uploading with Send that we showed true changes

138
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,920
to true.

139
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,310
And we will show this progress and whenever we are done uploading images and we get a response we will

140
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,100
change it back to false and hide.

141
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,430
They progress real simple.

142
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,770
So right.

143
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,890
Let's go to the render method.

144
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:42,620
So on the render what we do pretty much is to put a dev are going to put it inside of a section just

145
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,980
like this.

146
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,670
Let me do it right.

147
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:58,620
Section right inside of a section I will create a song so Deb I can add a class name of dropzone and

148
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,120
I going add the class clear does OK.

149
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,810
Now instead of here we will put the actual job something you know that square where we can drop things.

150
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:15,690
So we will need to bring dropzone from the top so dropzone and we need no opening close closed.

151
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,130
Now instead of the drop zone we need to pass them some properties.

152
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,940
Now we have this drop method that is going to fire every time we drop something.

153
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,310
So we say on drop in all of this is of course on the documentation of dropzone.

154
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,060
So whenever we drop some something we're going to get the event.

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:43,110
So we need to fire our function calls on drop could be called something else and we passed the event

156
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,860
right.

157
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,580
So this is our function this is not from dropsonde.

158
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:52,350
The only thing from Dab-Dab zone is this one the only thing we get is the event and then we run a function.

159
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,770
Right now you get the option multiple.

160
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,630
And in this case we upload images at one image at a time.

161
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,000
So it's false.

162
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,900
And then I get to add a class name of drop stone underscore box.

163
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,610
Right.

164
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,070
So instead of the job.

165
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,370
I want to add this icon.

166
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,210
So I'm going to say Dave I'm going to add a class and this is my code.

167
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,810
Is our code a class name of rap.

168
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,900
And I'm going to add that font.

169
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,340
Awesome icon.

170
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,670
So let me do it right font.

171
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:35,920
Awesome icon opening close and we need to pass the name of the icon which is a plus circle.

172
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,930
Breguet.

173
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,190
So in theory we should be getting something and we do.

174
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,250
You know we get this.

175
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,850
Now if I click it we get the file abla.

176
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,210
So that works.

177
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,490
Of course we need to do a lot more but at least that works.

178
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,090
All right.

179
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,150
So what else.

180
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,330
After the drop zone right after we upload an image what I want to do I want to show the images right

181
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:57,760
here.

182
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,960
I want to just kind of push inside of of an array and show the images right here.

183
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:13,980
So I'm going to create a function right here that says show uploaded images and this of course dysfunction

184
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,080
doesn't exist.

185
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,560
I'm going to create it and I'm going to leave it alone.

186
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,590
Right.

187
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,140
We're going to do it later of course.

188
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,150
Now whenever we are uploading remember that I want to show this progress bar so I'm going to create

189
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:34,140
one more rule and this one will be checking that this state that uploading now if it's true will show

190
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,050
the box and if it's not we will just return NULL.

191
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,520
And now this is something I've added after the project was completed.

192
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,450
So it's going to look a little bit weird going to add the class name of dropsonde box same box but I'm

193
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:55,620
adding some styles because again I am doing this after the project was completed when I was creating

194
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,400
the project.

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
So I'm going to change the text line to center.

196
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,840
Or you can skip this if you wish if you wish it to look ugly but the padding top of 60 pixels didn't

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,160
do much right here.

198
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:18,350
And of course here we will add the circular progress sort of circular progress.

199
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,480
We're going to close that.

200
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,180
And of course we need to pass some props.

201
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,360
We're going to change the style of the color.

202
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:34,660
So color opening close and I'm going to change again to put color 0 0 B C D for.

203
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,320
All right.

204
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
Kind of a bluish color.

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,450
And then the thickness and the thickness are going to put seven which is the biggest one.

206
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,090
The big one.

207
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:50,970
Yeah that's great of course we don't see it until we start uploading and check if the central when too

208
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,240
long now that we are going to do one more thing before we move on we go to the next section to finish.

209
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,010
So.

210
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:02,500
So whenever we drop we know that we are fighting this.

211
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:11,550
So we're going to go right here and say drop equals to a function and then we just do something and

212
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,220
what we get.

213
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,850
Of course it's just like we spoke before is the event.

214
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,970
Right now this event it's actually the files we are clicking on here.

215
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,900
Right.

216
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,660
It's opening the files when we just do it on the files.

217
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,070
When I do open that is when the this job is going to fire.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,980
Of course we are getting an error message but that is OK.

219
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,290
So this is data when the dropzone fires this event.

220
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,550
So I'm going to go right here and say event going to say files.

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,940
Like.

222
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:57,470
And right here we're going to get the files going to say console log files just to see what we get are

223
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:07,660
going to inspect going into the dropzone maybe upload a file and go to console and you know we get the

224
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,320
files and this is just a regular is how HDMI works.

225
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,860
You know the regular javascript nothing new so far.

226
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,470
Right here it's not react.

227
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,130
It's not a node or whatever.

228
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,530
It's just a regular javascript NHT now.

229
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:29,230
So when we get the on on drop of course we need to do a bunch of things we need to go grab the files

230
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,120
and go to the server.

231
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,810
We didn't have a route for this.

232
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,110
We can create pretty much all the logic right now.

233
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,790
But then on the next section we're going to go to the server and create a route to handle the upload.

234
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,680
So first on the set state what I want to do I want to say that now we are uploading so uploading and

235
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,650
then true.

236
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,160
So we will get that progress.

237
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,710
Now we need to do the form data.

238
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:01,810
And again this is just how we handle files on the web are going to create a new form data just like

239
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,130
this form data right.

240
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,800
Then of course we need to config whenever we do a post we need to set headers of multi-stop multipart

241
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,560
form data.

242
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,090
So Konst config config.

243
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,190
All right.

244
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,890
This is going to be equal to I'm going to say headers Collon and this and this is how we going to be

245
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,180
using inside access.

246
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,420
That's why I'm doing this just like this.

247
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:35,160
So we need a content than a type and the content type is going to be equal to multipart from data.

248
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:44,590
So multipart form form data by Burguet this is done.

249
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:51,780
Now whenever we create a new form data just like this we need to append the files to that form data.

250
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,570
So I'm going to make a reference to form data that penned and then I'm going to use the keyword file.

251
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,890
And this is the keyword we're going to be catching from the server to get the actual files.

252
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,970
So files are going to be passing the zero because we have one file and this is of course the way we

253
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,740
get it.

254
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,230
So now we need to do the actual posting.

255
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,900
So we're going to do a post request to and I'm going to set the route right here.

256
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:28,350
It's up for Slash API for Slash users for Slash and upload image.

257
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,750
If you're asking yourself why are you using users.

258
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,670
Well the thing is that the user only administer a million users.

259
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,000
And our users can upload this.

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,530
So again we're going to be using just users because the user is uploading the image to cloud denarii.

261
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,300
Then of course we get a start on a product but doesn't matter.

262
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,490
You know the one that the DPD the person that is doing the upload is just an open air user.

263
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,300
So that's why I'm using users.

264
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,890
And of course later you might be doing a lot of uploading for different sections so you just have one

265
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,720
single route for uploading images.

266
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,440
You don't have many.

267
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,360
So we need to pass to form data and we are almost done then coma and we need to pass that config.

268
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,630
So we do the config.

269
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,620
All right.

270
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:20,500
So then of course we get a promise opening close we get the response and after the response we do something.

271
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,300
All right.

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,190
So what are we going to be doing at the end.

273
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,470
It's going to be setting state so there's not set state opening close.

274
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,070
We're going to set that uploading back to falls because we are not uploading anymore.

275
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,600
We got a response and then we need to set the uploaded files.

276
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,640
Going to say uploaded files.

277
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,330
And if you remember this is of course an array.

278
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,150
Now maybe you're uploading images and you are uploading the third or fourth image.

279
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,360
It's not the first one.

280
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,910
So what you we need to do is to concatenate with whenever you get from the previews upload.

281
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,250
So you might have more files right here.

282
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:07,180
So what we do we just say that that does not state that uploaded files and this array will be equal

283
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,330
to whatever we get from the response plus all the previous files we had on that array.

284
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,120
Of course from the server we going to get a response.

285
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,910
So then I'm going to put the response that data now the response.

286
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:24,070
Are we going to handle it we're going to modify the response we get from cloud Inari and we will send

287
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,540
the response just the way we want it.

288
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,950
We want directly from the server.

289
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:35,650
All right so once we set the state what we will need to do is to go back to the parent component and

290
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,630
tell them OK I do have new images just add them to your form data state.

291
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,490
Right.

292
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,630
Of course we have the function.

293
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,810
So we need to do it.

294
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,890
But I'm going to put it right here is a callback of the said State.

295
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,590
We say this the props.

296
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,170
And remember we are already passing let go here.

297
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,630
We are already passing the props so it calls images handler.

298
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,550
Right.

299
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,470
And what are we going to be sending back to the parent component.

300
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:13,310
Well the uploaded files so I'm going to say is that state that uploaded files.

301
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,330
All right man.

302
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,400
That is it.

303
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,190
Of course we need to do more things right here.

304
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,600
And remember that whenever we set up we upload something we do are we said.

305
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,160
Right.

306
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,760
So we need to catch that as well.

307
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,280
But again went too long now.

308
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,370
The section went too long.

309
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,960
So let's go to the next one and we will go to the server and create the route so we can finally upload

310
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,480
the image.

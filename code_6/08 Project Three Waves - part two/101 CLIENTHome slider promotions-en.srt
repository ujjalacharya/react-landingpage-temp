1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,240
OK so now what are we going to do on this section.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,720
It's going to be the slider at home and then of course we're going to do this which is the promotions

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,640
section inside home.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,840
So I'm going to do this and I'm not going to teach you anything new of this.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,340
We can already did it.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,910
And at the first in the first part of this project the first version of this project this one the you

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,170
know the title and everything else.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,410
It's not going to be really linked with the server.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,500
What we get from the server I'm going to add later much later I could add a bonus section so we can

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,860
of course create a part on the dashboard so we can enter you know all the promotional stuff in home

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,980
and you know do a lot more set up.

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,630
And of course again it's not going to be anything new.

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,230
That's why I'm leaving this in a bonus section you know relating this to the server.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,350
So there's two choices you can.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,050
We can build it right now with me.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,090
Right now we're going to do it or you can you know at the end of the session get the code and just put

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,320
it on your on your project and that's it because again I'm not going to teach you anything new right

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,120
here.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,840
All right.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,560
So we're going to start building this first.

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,850
I'm going to start with this lighter.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,500
So of course if we go home nothing happens.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,780
We need to include this.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,960
So OK so I'm going to go right here.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,360
And the clothes are going to close everything.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,770
And we've already have a route for this for this because this home we have the index.

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,410
So I'm going to just inside of home are going to build two different files.

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,990
I'm going to say that I want a home underscore slider digests and then I want the other one which is

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,360
the promotion's So it's home underscore promotion that.

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,970
OK first I'm going to start with the slider because there's a little bit more complex than the other

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,690
one.

32
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:55,380
So first we need to react component right here so we could create a stateless component so we act stateless

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,360
components.

34
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,190
And there's one of course it's going to be called home.

35
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,520
And then slider a little bit nicer homes lighter.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,520
All right well we'll be receiving Propst.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,080
You're not going to maybe really use it.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,170
We could use it much much later on the application but not for now.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,790
But I'm going to leave it ready right here.

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,740
So I'm going to open right here.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,550
And first we need to create slides.

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,580
So I need the information that we're going to be rendering.

43
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,970
So we have an image.

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,660
Let's let's go alone.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,640
We have an image.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,020
We have the first line which is the beast dog.

47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,850
We have a second line that we can set up.

48
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,680
And then of course the button which is the link to.

49
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,160
OK.

50
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:40,230
So I'm going to go Raheel the top and say Konst sleights equal to an array.

51
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,280
Now you might have many slides.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,910
So that's why we need an array of objects.

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,600
So image and now I'm going to leave it empty.

54
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,240
Then we have line one just like this line 1.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,110
And by default of course we can add only two lines one title and a you know a second line so Line 1

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,620
are going to leave it for now enty coma.

57
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,650
We have a line.

58
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,370
So Line 2 are going to leave it empty.

59
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,910
And what else.

60
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,740
We have a link title which is what.

61
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,230
What is the button going to say bew offers or no shop now or whatever.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,460
So we have the link.

63
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,750
Title equals right now to nothing.

64
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,640
And then we have the link to.

65
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,000
So where that link is going to go.

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,100
OK now I'm going to copy this one at the top.

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,800
We're going to put a coma at the bottom and chest you know.

68
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,640
Paste it.

69
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,720
OK.

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,950
So this one right now like it's all before we will not fetch this from the server.

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,340
We're going to just prefix everything right here.

72
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,910
Just you know hard code everything.

73
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,340
So again if you go to images to the images directory inside public images you can get the feature and

74
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,620
right here you get the images.

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,810
So I give you three.

76
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,440
You can add just two slides right here.

77
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:07,530
So go for flash images for Slash featured for Slash and I believe the first one it's featured just like

78
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,130
this featured underscore home that JP.

79
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,730
All right.

80
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,350
So this line for the first line is going to say Fender which is a brand of a guitar than custom shop

81
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,660
which is the first line.

82
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,480
And then of course the linked of the title which is going to be sharp now.

83
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,580
Right.

84
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,660
Then we're going to go to shop which is the shop section you know shop right here.

85
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,830
And of course we're going to do something more intelligent because we're going to do this on the bonus

86
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,010
at the end of the you know the course because maybe you want to shop custom shop guitars.

87
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,550
So we going to need to quit whenever we add to guitars and guitar.

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,400
Say that this one is a Fender and maybe this one it's a custom shop so we're going to be able to check

89
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,740
by category or something like that so we can pass something like.

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,550
I don't know.

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,900
But category Khattak equals custom shop and this will that we will detect this on the shop section on

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,160
the guitar section and bring from the server.

93
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,650
Only the ones with categories custom shop.

94
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:12,940
All right.

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,050
But of course we're going to do that much much later.

96
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm going to copy this one right here and again paste paste it and the name for this one is going to

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,940
be underscored.

98
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,590
And this one will be saying be stock.

99
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,840
If you don't know what a beast archetype is it's the guitars that they have maybe scratch or defect

100
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,890
or something like that.

101
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,810
So they have to charge you a little bit less this counts.

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,410
All right then the button is going to say bew offers.

103
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,740
And it's going to go to shop.

104
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,750
Same place for now.

105
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,610
OK.

106
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,630
Now we need to use a slider and we've installed the re-act slick we use previously.

107
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:03,580
So import that slider from re-act slick.

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,010
All right.

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,480
Well as we're going to use but in ABBERTON so I'm going to import my button and we're going to bring

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,090
this from the Tilse So does that force slash tails buttons.

111
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,970
So for now this is the only thing we need.

112
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,670
All right.

113
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,210
OK.

114
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,320
So let's go with the button.

115
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:27,720
And if you remember the slider needs some settings so I'm going to say Konst settings settings.

116
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,400
There you go settings.

117
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,100
That's good.

118
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,590
So we all need to pass an object.

119
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,070
And first we just say if we want the dots you know the dots to handle the slides.

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
I don't want them.

121
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,640
So I'm going to say falls coma.

122
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,150
We need to decide if it's going to be infinite.

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,810
An infinite slider.

124
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,330
This is going to be true.

125
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,700
What else we need to speed we can set up the speed of the slider.

126
00:06:51,710 --> 00:07:02,810
So speed 500 milliseconds and slide to show one all of this is the kind of the default configuration

127
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,190
of the slick.

128
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,690
So you can check this on the documentations of course of very slick.

129
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,190
So then to scroll begin to say one comma and arrows.

130
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,370
I don't really like the arrows on sliders.

131
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,620
I don't know why.

132
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,500
No I don't really like them.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,260
All right.

134
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,080
So we have the settings.

135
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:29,440
It's going to go right here at the bottom and say OK do we want a class name off featured and then container.

136
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,810
This is the main wrapper.

137
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,480
And then of course we will create a slider.

138
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,850
Now the slider needs the settings so we can grab the Barville and say OK dot dot dot put whatever settings

139
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,620
we have inside of the slider.

140
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,050
Now of course we need to add the slides and we have kind of state.

141
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,030
So OK.

142
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:56,900
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to create a function called generate slides open and close.

143
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,120
We didn't have this function.

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,580
We need to create it right now.

145
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,340
So I'm going to go to General slides opening close and then of course we just return a function.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,870
Now this function will be returning GSX.

147
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,900
So we can roll back and do this all right.

148
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,270
We can know this.

149
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,490
So then if we do have slides and I'm adding that of course we have slides but I'm adding this because

150
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,180
later we will fetch a slice from the server.

151
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,690
So I'm going to kind of leave it Friday for now.

152
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
Of course this is going to change a little bit later.

153
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,140
Now I'm going to do sleights dot map opening close in on each iteration.

154
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:43,770
We will get an item again that data transfer item item and I can at Cookout and then do coma.

155
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,720
I hate that.

156
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,270
So why not for the duration.

157
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,650
And again we still return some GSX.

158
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,690
So opening close so are going to create a def and this Ziv needs a key and the key is going to be the

159
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,400
iteration.

160
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,010
All right.

161
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,900
So instead of here we have a couple of things.

162
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,150
We have the background image which is going to be the feature image.

163
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,810
And inside we have some actions like the title and then you know the button.

164
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,570
All right.

165
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,900
So the first line first Dev is going to be the container which contains the image.

166
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,960
So I'm going to say class name and then featured image.

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,760
All right.

168
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,510
Then of course we need to add the styles and inside of styles We'll have the actual image.

169
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:34,180
So style opening close and I'm going to say that the background of this bad boy is can it be you are

170
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,310
all opening close and we pass the image Eurail which is going to be inside EMG ride.

171
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,000
OK.

172
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:51,820
We do eat item that EMG we need set up height because we are not really using an EMG Tac.

173
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:01,630
And I'm going to set this height to the height of the window Sargen to say window window dart inner

174
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,840
height.

175
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,730
There we go.

176
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,550
And then of course we can attach pixels to this Breguet pretty much ready.

177
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:16,940
Now I'm going to go inside and say DIVX and make a table inside of the dip of the actual image that

178
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,260
contains the deck that contains the image.

179
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,850
I'm going to add a class name and call it featured action.

180
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:32,570
At this point we should be getting something at least of course we are not including the home slider

181
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,350
from home.

182
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,230
So OK.

183
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:42,820
Important Than Home slider from Scott for slashed home slider and again corrections.

184
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,300
Right this right here.

185
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,540
Open and close.

186
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,870
And again we should be getting something.

187
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,760
And General sleights it's not defined.

188
00:10:50,780 --> 00:11:00,650
I know what my promise slides generate slides and it's because I didn't do Constantines lights.

189
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,530
All right.

190
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,040
Let's get really ugly.

191
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,760
But we can get it all right.

192
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,320
OK.

193
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,460
Let's get.

194
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,230
So let's go back to the home slider.

195
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,820
And this is actually mistake we're going to fix it in a couple minutes.

196
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,300
But for now it's cool.

197
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,380
So OK.

198
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,830
Featured action.

199
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,290
And I'm going to add the title.

200
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:27,140
It's going to be a div off and at the class name the class name off track and title.

201
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,250
Notice that there is no underscore right here.

202
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,050
And then of course we pass the item and the line 1 we do pretty much the same thing for the other one.

203
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,720
Do it right.

204
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,540
Same thing for the other one.

205
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,910
And this one is going to be low tile or it could be a lower title doesn't matter.

206
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,260
So lion too.

207
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,430
All right let's see what we get.

208
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,810
All right let's get.

209
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,580
So what else we need the button.

210
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,290
So we're going to create a div and I'm going to say OK I want to bring my butt in right here.

211
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,490
And again we just use the default link.

212
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:10,930
So we need to pass the type which is default then we pass the title just like this and it's equal to

213
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,600
item that link title.

214
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:22,640
Then we pass the link to and the link to it's equal to item DOD link to.

215
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,540
I believe we call it link to.

216
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,070
All right.

217
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,770
Yeah.

218
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,020
Then I'm going to add some default Starling's to remove the margins at Styles and we are always on right

219
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,870
that margin opening close 10 pixel's 000 and that is it.

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,490
All right.

221
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,710
If I go to shop now of course we are going to shop.

222
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,040
So let's fix this previous.

223
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,670
I'm pretty sure that this isn't my mistake on the settings.

224
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,170
So yeah it should be arrows.

225
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,300
It was my mistake.

226
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,050
All right.

227
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,840
So OK.

228
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,590
So the application loads we get the slider and it's the same hypothesis that we know and if we go to

229
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,100
the next one we can get it for good.

230
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,430
So later we get it fetched.

231
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,790
All of this data right here from the server directly from the server.

232
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,630
All right.

233
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,830
So let's move on.

234
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,470
Let's do the other one which is the right here.

235
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,060
They have promotions which is going to be real simple it's just a background image.

236
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:27,840
The text at the top and then the button it so let's go to our project and we go to home promotion.

237
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,420
So this one reacts stalest component.

238
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,320
And again home promotion of course we will get it done.

239
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,630
So we need to import my button from.

240
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,940
And it is going to be that for slashed hotels forward slash buttons or button.

241
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,780
Right.

242
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,700
We can receive some props.

243
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,080
What really happened Rob happening right now.

244
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,940
So I'm going to create a viable cold promotion equals opening close.

245
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,080
And we pretty much need the same thing with Dad and home slider.

246
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,840
So I'm going to go to Home slider copy all of this and I get it.

247
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,230
Paste it right here.

248
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,210
Now we need a different image.

249
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,640
And of course different values so for this in this one is going to be underscored and three.

250
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,470
Oh now I remember now.

251
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,630
Now I know how would we get a three because

252
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,790
yeah.

253
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,160
No.

254
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,430
OK.

255
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,180
That's fine.

256
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,740
I know what we got three.

257
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,910
It's two for the slider.

258
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,370
And then you know the other one is for the for the actually you know background.

259
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,620
OK.

260
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm sorry for that.

261
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,020
So that's good.

262
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,920
We're going to use a image number three.

263
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,560
So right here I'm going to say up to 40 percent.

264
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,860
So this container right now it's you know these components are not really important for us to practice.

265
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,240
They are really really easy to do.

266
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:04,870
So in second I didn't put too much thought on this ones so guitars and then shop now and then we're

267
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,780
still going to shop.

268
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:17,490
So right here at the bottom I'm going to add a class name and it's going to say home promotion promotion.

269
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,920
And each side will create a function render promotion.

270
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,990
Or it could be show promotion or something like that.

271
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,010
So again Konst render promotion.

272
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,010
And we just returned some GSX.

273
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:38,080
So Ronayne right now we just need to say if we do have a promotion we're going to do something if not

274
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,460
begin to do null.

275
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,660
All right.

276
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:49,360
So what we're going to be returning to is just a div with the class name off home promotion underscore

277
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,260
EMG could be container.

278
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,880
You have used container.

279
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,930
That's OK.

280
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:02,860
So when he said the background style opening close and we say back round and the background it's equal

281
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:17,400
to you are opening close and we use promotion that EMG and promotion going to get rid of a lot of a

282
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,040
lot a lot of plugins.

283
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:25,760
So OK now I'm going to cheat because we have pretty much the same information on this one than we have

284
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,990
in the home slider.

285
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,490
So I will copy this ones from here.

286
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,760
The button the tag title and the low title.

287
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,100
And I can paste them right here.

288
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:44,010
So again you're kind of cheating but you know it's better than just typing the whole component again.

289
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,490
You know everything again.

290
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,790
So I need to format or get.

291
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,240
So we get still a default and this one instead of item is going to be promotion.

292
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,780
So we're going to change the items for promotion promotion and promotion and that is it is done you

293
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,580
know really really fast.

294
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,910
So let's include this from home.

295
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,960
So we are almost done.

296
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,980
I know that this was boring and it was it was boring for me and I'm pretty sure that it was boring for

297
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,140
you because again are not learning anything new promotion

298
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,410
and home promotion.

299
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,350
All right.

300
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,020
If I included a home promotion and then we close it.

301
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,820
We should be getting something at least.

302
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,500
Yeah.

303
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,910
So it's OK.

304
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,640
I'm not getting the right here.

305
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,170
The paddings like we do get here.

306
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,570
Well let me check why.

307
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,410
All right.

308
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,950
It's because I did Priem permission.

309
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,680
So promotion and that is it.

310
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,290
OK.

311
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:57,230
So I'm going to skip the project so you can get this two files and then you just need to include them.

312
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,720
If you didn't follow the instructions right here you know you didn't create the component right here

313
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,440
with me.

314
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,620
You just can get it you know from that from that zip file and just included was simply too simple.

315
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,350
So on the next sections you're not going to do something really simple.

316
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,450
You're going to go to something fun which is this.

317
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,030
So what we need to do we need to create first a component that is going to be rendering some carts and

318
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,990
then we need to create a component that is going to be ruling each cart.

319
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,900
And remember that each component.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,710
Each card has a new to you but it's you know there's one to add something to items and the new product.

321
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,530
Right.

322
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,270
And then of course we need to do fetch from the server so we can get the best selling guitars and we

323
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,550
can we need to get going need to fetch from the server they get new arrivals.

324
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,410
So again the next one it's kind of important.

325
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,060
Right.

326
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,400
OK.

327
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,370
So let's go to the next section and start with this.

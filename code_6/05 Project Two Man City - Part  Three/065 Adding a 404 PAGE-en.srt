1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:09,440
OK so let's add a not found screen because if I go to whatever you know it's kind of a to go but it's

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,130
not really going.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,970
And the thing is that let me show you why whenever we go two routes it's Riak Browder it's entering

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,970
here it's reading OK it's going going and since it's not finding anything it's not it's not returning

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,630
anything.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,590
So we will create a scenario for you know for no match for not not found.

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:36,410
So I'm going to host it inside you I because it's not a very super important route so I've not found

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,410
you could create inside components and not found file or not found directories.

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,350
It's completely up to you now not found.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,840
This case is going to be really simple.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,750
So going to react statelets component.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,790
So this one not found not found.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:05,030
And I'm going to add a class and not found container not found container.

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,860
All right.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,170
So inside of the not found.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,720
But I'm going to do something so simple.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,160
Sorry maybe sorry.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,740
And a sad face or I'm sorry sad face sad face.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,440
There we go.

20
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:26,830
And at the bottom I'm going to create a new dev saying Page Not Found.

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,010
All right super simple.

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,410
Now of course we need to bring this to routes so I'm going to go to public route because it is a public

23
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:43,100
route import not found from that forward slash and this time we need to go to you.

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:52,770
So it's not inside it's inside components and you go.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,710
So the component calls not found.

26
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,830
That is it.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,590
So no.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,450
And here's the thing.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,320
This is like a totally a little before.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,860
This is how we react router works starts reading routes from the top.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,750
So if we put it at the top is going to match whatever we passing on the not found because they've not

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,400
found has no routes is going to display the route.

33
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,430
If it's not finding anything but if we put it first it would always display that that found because

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,140
they matched the route it's going to match it.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,440
So we always always always we need to put it at the end.

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,610
Ride is the final route that will match.

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,600
So I'm going to copy the home I'm going to put it right here.

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,600
We still pass the props if you want to restrict it the path and the path.

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,350
We don't need a path.

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,760
So this is what happens with not found.

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,490
We don't need a path is going to match whatever route we are passing but has to be the last one.

42
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,400
So I'm going to go to not found in a pace not found.

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,460
And now if I type what ever we go to not found very good of course if I go home it goes home if I go

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,660
to matches of the team or the matches.

45
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,530
That works if I try again.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,140
Not really happening.

47
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,800
Burguet What is it.

48
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,360
OK.

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,850
So right.

50
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,730
So at this point we did a lot of things on the application.

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,280
So the dashboard the outman we know how to upload how I have to upload files how to create forms and

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,570
we didn't you know we did a lot of things but the most important thing is the authentication is the

53
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,570
most usable thing I believe for it from firebase database.

54
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,250
Maybe not so much like I told you before and maybe if you come from a different course with me you know

55
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,350
I don't like that much.

56
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,270
The database of firebase.

57
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,010
Why.

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,950
Because it's a very simple database.

59
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,980
You don't get to do a lot of things if you want to do complex queries or something like that.

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,640
Firebase is not maybe the choice for you is to do simple things simple stuff.

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:13,290
You know it's a very slim database and Burslem API for this one you know works good could work.

62
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:23,120
So on the next section what we can do we can create a built of our our components our you know our project

63
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,580
and we're going to change some of the rules inside the database and the storage because so far if I

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,660
upload this to production or whatever anyone can read and anyone could write so we can change some of

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,250
the settings and we're going to use to see a live or firebase to push everything to hosting if we go

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:47,150
to hosting we can deploy it to their hosting and they will give us a fake u r l where we can see our

67
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,740
you know our project working with authentic cation and everything else so we can host it inside firebase.

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,310
All right.

69
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,380
So let's go to the next one and do this.

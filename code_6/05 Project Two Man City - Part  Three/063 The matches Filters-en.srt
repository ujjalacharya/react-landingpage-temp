1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,720
All right let's do the lay out right here.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,010
It's going to be really simple.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:11,040
So instead of here are going to create a div with a class name just like this and I'm going to add the

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,290
class name of Bach's wrapper like that.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,410
BLOCK wrappers sorry.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,220
BLOCK wrapper.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,060
All right.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,740
So instead of here we get two different blocks.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,740
And this block wrapper would be the one that is going to be rubbing the two teams on both teams very

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,290
good.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,970
So inside block opening close and the first block are going to call going to call it block.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,770
So this one will host the first team.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,660
They're going to close this so we can clearly see this.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,080
So the first thing it's the icon the icon of the team.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,560
So class name icon.

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,720
And this one will of course we need to add the style to this.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,350
So it's going to be style equals opening close.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,020
Now of course we need to add chess to background.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,200
Just a background.

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,040
So it's going to be background just like this.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,870
And who me bring it at the bottom.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,110
Not to look a little bit weird.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,380
So background we use template strengths we use.

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:22,380
You are opening close and if you remember the logos the team logos are inside the public directory inside

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,240
images and team icons.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,270
So we need to make a reference to that.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,630
So it's for Slash images.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,570
Just like this images for Slash theme icons for Slash then opening close.

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,880
And now we use that data key we have right here.

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:46,710
So it's data DOD and the one on the top is the local So local.

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,540
Capital T H M B.

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,830
That is the name of that.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,270
And then of course we attach that P.A. and that is it.

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,550
You could put no repeat that it's OK for you.

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,350
So OK the next thing it's going to be the name of the team.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:12,120
So leave class name open and close with a class of team and inside of here we make reference to data

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,990
that local.

38
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,430
And that's it.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,800
The next thing they're going to copy office is going to be salt.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,880
So result data that result.

41
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:31,490
And then again local ME FIX IT resold and then local are added.

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,940
Ok sorry.

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,200
Result local.

44
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,910
OK.

45
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,730
Sorry for that.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,730
So OK so if the application reloads Let's see what happens if you don't get anything.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,100
Well let's get we get what we are not getting is the actual icon.

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,020
So let me see thing icons made a mistake right there.

49
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,150
So this is kind of late already and I've been being actually recording this the whole day.

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,800
So I'm a little bit tired but we're almost done and I want to quit right now.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,720
OK.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,630
So we have the first block.

53
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,080
We need the second block.

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,060
So I'm going to copy this one going to go at the bottom just paste it.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:20,370
And now we need to make reference to a way data local data way and data results local data results away.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
All right let's see how it goes.

57
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,450
All right.

58
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,840
There's it very simple.

59
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,630
OK.

60
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,940
So now we are going to add the info.

61
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,050
Real simple stuff.

62
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,710
OK.

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,810
So we have the block wrapper which is the first one.

64
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,250
And then again to add a new block wrapper just here below.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,090
And then Dave but this one has an additional class of fault for info.

66
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,920
Right.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,480
All right.

68
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:55,710
So this one def and inside will have a strong and the strong is going to be you know the actual key

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,060
just date.

70
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,220
And then of course we put the date.

71
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,740
So data data that date.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,720
All right.

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,250
The next one is the stadium's up get a copy of this one.

74
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:18,560
And then of course stadium and stadium and the next one is the referee.

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,960
So rare for a read.

76
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,760
And of course again referee.

77
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,230
All right.

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,430
We'll see if this works the application reloads.

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,120
And OK.

80
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,720
It is getting weird.

81
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,570
Of course something is broken.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,300
So we have the blog robber what you see with him.

83
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,560
But my mistake is block block wrapper.

84
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,030
Let me see one second.

85
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,070
Find a mistake I'm pretty sure it's really silly.

86
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,300
Oh of gays.

87
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,390
So I know I know I know what the promise this rapper Eminem was take on the class I did.

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,970
I went with one P..

89
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,480
Same thing right here.

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,230
This is a mistake on the CSX.

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,440
So we were loaded.

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,990
There we go.

93
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,420
OK.

94
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,590
That is get if you want you can go to the CSSA and change the name for this you know fix it that you

95
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,440
know there's no need to do that.

96
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:16,970
All right.

97
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,060
So what are we going to be doing right now.

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,000
It's this filtering thing.

99
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,720
This boxes and they are really really simple pretty straightforward.

100
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:32,290
I just add them to the project to show you how no group can work with they you know some changes on

101
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,350
the actual actual object you know the Jayson object.

102
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,080
All right so let's add the filter boxes something we can add the template first real simple and then

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,090
we will add the functions to filter.

104
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,600
Now we are not.

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,230
Again we are not going to do something very complex.

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,350
Notice that if I make a change in this filter it and I change this one this one resets.

107
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,470
So we are doing one filter all the time.

108
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,870
You're not mixing both.

109
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,500
All right.

110
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,650
Real simple.

111
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,270
OK.

112
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,440
So inside match filters we can have two boxes you know two different filters.

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,530
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to say Dave and I are going to wrap that box inside of a you

114
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,700
know a class.

115
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,830
So inside match filters this one each box is going to be called is going to have a class name.

116
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,920
Class name of match underscore filter's underscore and then box.

117
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,700
Now each box has a title.

118
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,100
So Dave open it close.

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,130
Class name and I call that night called the.

120
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:42,050
So the first one is going to be for the show match so the show match will toggle between the played

121
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,270
match and the not played matches right.

122
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,130
OK.

123
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,310
So after the attack I can at you know the actual buttons.

124
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,490
So this container calls can't just you know not right container.

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,560
So each option.

126
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,350
We need a device which is pretty much debone.

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,680
The first one in this case the on the show match is going to be all.

128
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,310
And again to do the other things I'm going to add a class name.

129
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,610
So the class name for this one and it's going to be option.

130
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,380
Now later we need to change the classes of which one is selected and which ones.

131
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,920
Which one is not going to do that at the end.

132
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,180
But since we're going to be swapping classes I'm going to use template strings and in this one I'm going

133
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,740
to put this option later.

134
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,530
We're going to going to change it right.

135
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,890
Don't worry.

136
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,250
Now later of course we need to add an unclick.

137
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,610
But for now I'm going to finish this so all and we have three options the first one is all.

138
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,920
The second one it's played.

139
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,000
And the third one.

140
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,140
It's not played.

141
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,470
At all right.

142
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,380
We should at least get something

143
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,580
until we get it.

144
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,050
Of course they're not clickable.

145
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,760
You can add that functionality right now.

146
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,620
OK.

147
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:06,200
So what we need to do whenever we click and all and it showed all the results if I click and played

148
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,660
again across this database that we have the state actually the filter matches.

149
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm going to call and only show the ones that say play and the keyboard.

150
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,210
Yes.

151
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,340
And this actually comes from the database.

152
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,900
If I go to the database we have the right here the property here.

153
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,590
Here we go.

154
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,620
So we have a final so final it's going to be yes or no.

155
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,660
So if I check the other ones.

156
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,260
No.

157
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,700
Of course the final.

158
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,570
Yes it's going to be the one that was already played and the No.

159
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,130
The one that is not played.

160
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,710
All right.

161
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,810
So we can use the keyboard yes or no.

162
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,230
Real simple not a boolean.

163
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,210
It did with yes no.

164
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,770
So it could be a little bit easier to understand.

165
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,490
All right.

166
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,310
OK.

167
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,450
So now whenever we click I need to tell the application to filter that and for this of course you're

168
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,160
going to create a function.

169
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,920
So I'm going to go right here and whenever I do an unclick just like this I want to run a function open

170
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:13,800
and close and I going to run a function called this that show and then play it makes sense.

171
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,050
And is this option.

172
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,370
It's all I going to say.

173
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,680
All I need to do the same thing pretty much for all the other options.

174
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,370
So this one instead of all is going to be yes.

175
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,320
And the next one is going to be on click Show play.

176
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,450
Yes actually no.

177
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,000
Burguet of course we didn't have this function created right here so show played is just a function

178
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:51,260
and it will be receiving that played as an argument so we can use just filter from javascript.

179
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,840
And a creator Konst concert.

180
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,830
There we go.

181
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:02,790
And I'm going to call it list and it's going to be equal to the filtered the final filtered you know

182
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,090
army of objects.

183
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:11,400
So this state that matches I'm entering the list where we have all the matches all of the matches.

184
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,660
Now the filter matches and are going to say OK what I want to do I want to filter open and close and

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,370
on each iteration I'm going to use matches could be match actually match just like this.

186
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,640
And of course we will return something.

187
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:38,160
So what we return is going to be all the match which final it's equal to whatever argument we are passing.

188
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,860
So this will be returning all the.

189
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,420
For example if we select all is going to is going to return pretty much all in a check in a minute.

190
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,720
To fix it.

191
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,360
But if they played it's equal to.

192
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,940
Yes.

193
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,280
It will filter and bring all the elements right here where we have yes.

194
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,430
And it will skip all the notes.

195
00:10:59,490 --> 00:10:59,940
Right.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,610
OK.

197
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,610
Makes sense.

198
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,950
It's very simple just a filter function.

199
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,450
It's.

200
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,000
This is not react.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,150
So then what are we going to do.

202
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,870
And this part it's important.

203
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,570
We're going to set the state.

204
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,650
And now I'm going to use filter matches if you remember the filter matches is the property that the

205
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,970
No.

206
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,420
Group these matches list is going to be using.

207
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,460
So whenever I do filter matches I need to check if they're resolved it is keyword displayed.

208
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,710
It's going to be all because if it's old I just return the whole damn thing.

209
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,530
The whole matches no all the list of matches if not are going to be returning whenever we get back from

210
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,520
the list.

211
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,760
So in this case I'm going to say okay I'm going to go back and I'm going to say if I played.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,840
It's equal to triple equal to all.

213
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:57,210
What we want to do we just want to return to this that state that matches matches.

214
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,200
All right.

215
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,170
If not we're going to be returning whatever whatever we have inside the list and we need to do a few

216
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,340
more things.

217
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,810
Now if you remember at the top you were using the player filter and the resoled filter.

218
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,660
And this is the default state.

219
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,000
Right now we just have the show match which is going to be all but later we're going to have the result

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,600
game which is.

221
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,150
Oh.

222
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,040
All right.

223
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,570
So this is the default state of this despondence since we can filter only one thing.

224
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,620
What are you going to do if we click on this one.

225
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,660
We're going to reset this one back to zero and then backwards.

226
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,530
If we select something this one goes back to zero.

227
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,490
So what do we do.

228
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,490
Right here we just change the state of that are going to say Play play or filter is going to be equal

229
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:49,860
to whatever we get from played which could be all yes or no and then coma and the result FELTER is going

230
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,360
to be equal to all.

231
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,790
So we result we said the other one back to the beginning.

232
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,440
All right.

233
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,700
So I got to reload the application and let's see if it works.

234
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,610
So if I go to all that get we get all if I go to played and nothing.

235
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,530
And if I go not play nothing I'm pretty sure there is something wrong.

236
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,420
This looks OK and this is a problem.

237
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,090
It's no instead of no way.

238
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,520
All right I'm going to reload the application and let's see if it works.

239
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,100
So if I go play let's get most of them up or play.

240
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,950
If I go not played we get only one match.

241
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:35,750
So let me change this from the database because I'm pretty sure I made a mistake on this one.

242
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,410
One second.

243
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,140
Let's do the following.

244
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,750
We have a dashboard we can edit matches from our application.

245
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,870
So what is scenario scenario to you know change them.

246
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,750
They're all final.

247
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,570
That's why we are not getting this.

248
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:54,210
So I'm going to go maybe Tottenham and I'm going to change it to no.

249
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,130
And of course since he's not played the return the result is 0 0 0.

250
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,440
Whatever doesn't matter and result none available so EDID match.

251
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:12,860
And if we go to matches we get not played and now we get to see how that works played.

252
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,750
And there we go.

253
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,010
You know it works.

254
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,520
All right.

255
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,940
So now of course we need to add the other one the result game and then to toggle the classis inside

256
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,550
of here.

257
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,970
Well let's go to the next section and finish.

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,980
We're going to finish the matches after that we will add a not found page but that's going to be really

259
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,750
simple.

260
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,960
And then of course we will grab everything with DID and we're going to push it to production.

261
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,350
We're going to push it to find base hosting.

262
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,820
We have the ability to host our project right here so we can do that.

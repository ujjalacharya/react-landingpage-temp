1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,090
All right.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,440
So this is what we're going to be doing the theme route.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,420
So if I load this of course we have a transition effect around with all the players.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,520
Nice effect.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,570
And of course we have categories right here in midfield defense keepers.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,610
So right from the start the first thing we need to do is create a route and then fetch the list of players

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,780
from the server.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,170
Right.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,540
OK.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,520
So let's go back to our application and I'm going to go back here.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,360
All right.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,430
So I'm going to delete edit players I'm going to close it actually for uploader firebase we don't need

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,960
it.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,490
So what we need to do we need to create a route.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:47,520
So I'm going to go inside components and again to create a new directory called the team the team right

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,290
and the team we will use just one file because it's not a lot of code.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,110
It's going to be a little bit weird a little bit weird but not a lot of code.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,910
So this one of course will be a re-act class based component just like this.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,520
I'm going to save it and of course this is going to be called the team.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,420
Ryan the team or could be meet the team or something like that.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
Again you can call this whatever you want.

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,130
Doesn't matter.

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,020
So right here the team Burguet.

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,560
So now we need to include this inside routes.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:32,550
So this is a public route going to go here import the team from that forward slash component's forward

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,280
slash.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,800
Then the team.

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,930
All right we're going to add this this public crowd.

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,320
Just like to sign in but I can copy the one from home.

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,850
Put it right here at the top let me close this and we will use boobie.

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,070
We will be using the team and then the team.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh sorry.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,830
On this one.

34
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,540
And this is going to happen whenever we go to the route called the team.

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,030
Right.

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,830
OK.

37
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,170
So the team.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,260
All right.

39
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,460
So if in theory we go to the team at least we get no errors.

40
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,810
So if I inspect this we get a div below is called the team.

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,730
Very good.

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,350
So now the first thing is going to be importing all the things we're going to need right.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,870
So with the team we need a few things.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:30,770
If you remember we've already did this play or cart we have it inside you I right here play your cart

45
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,830
so we will need to import that.

46
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:46,080
So import play your player and then card from than a dot dot for Slash you I forward slash and then

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,160
player cart right done.

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,810
Then we use We'll use a fading effect.

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,720
So import then fade from.

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,360
And this one is going to be re-act reveal forward slash and then of course fade brigade.

51
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,470
What is next.

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,510
Now if you notice we have this background and we've already used this inside home right here and this

53
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,190
section is a little bit different but pretty much the same the same as pride.

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,200
So I'm going to import import.

55
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,480
There we go.

56
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,970
And it's called Strypes just like this.

57
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:33,540
Strypes from Dot dot dot dot for Slash resources for Slash images for Slash.

58
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,160
And then I believe I called this tripes that PMG.

59
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,110
Very good.

60
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,340
All right.

61
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,850
Next again we need to make a request to firebase.

62
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:51,650
So we need to import some things from firebase first firebase and then the players and next since we

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,300
are going to be checking the storage for the images firebase from firebase.

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,470
Let me make it right.

65
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,070
All right.

66
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:09,790
Next one oh of course I need to set the from the dot for Slash forward slash and then firebase Burguet.

67
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,870
Next we need the firebase Luper.

68
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,430
So import open and close firebase and then Luper remember that the data comes in a weird way.

69
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:27,140
So we are going to change it with this and this one it's inside dot dot dot dot for Slash you eye and

70
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,940
then Miscellanies.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:38,750
And last but not least I'm going to import promise just like this with a capital P promise Fromme then

72
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,900
core dodginess very good core jazz.

73
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,210
So OK let's get.

74
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:52,280
And you going to see why we are using this begin to of course check this in context because the problem

75
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,830
is it's kind of hard to explain.

76
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:01,030
So first the our component it will start with the state of loading and then falls.

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,240
True because whenever the application loads up we need to load the list of players first and then of

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,430
course when we have the players we can to store them inside the state.

80
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,140
Now first let's try to fetch the list of players.

81
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,290
So I'm going to do it on the component at Mount opening close and on the component that Mount we need

82
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,190
to of course enter firebase players.

83
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,580
OK I just lost the connection.

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,720
Maybe you see this.

85
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,230
And there we go.

86
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,350
I don't know what happened.

87
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,260
So.

88
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,670
So component in Mt..

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,570
I'm going to save fire base then players dot and once just like we did before.

90
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,240
So an axis in the value.

91
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,620
And then I'm going to say then of course we will get our promise with a snapshot.

92
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,110
All right.

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,600
Opening close.

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,860
So when whenever we get this we need to get the list of players in a way we want so Konst players.

95
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:05,210
This one it's going to be equal to firebase Luper opening close and we passed a snapshot right.

96
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,660
So now what I'm going to do I'm going to do console log.

97
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,520
And then players the application will reload of course and in a minute we get this.

98
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,180
So this is what we get.

99
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,400
Of course we get a list of players from the server and inside of this we have the image right.

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,530
And this is a problem for us right now.

101
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:32,950
We have 20 elements with an image that we cannot really use because we don't have to download your app

102
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,260
which we just have the name of the image and storing the your L inside the image directly.

103
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,480
Not a good idea.

104
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,260
OK.

105
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,760
So what do we need to do now.

106
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,220
We need to go to the storage and for each entry on each player and for each player we need to grab the

107
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,710
name of the image go to firebase storage and bring the download out.

108
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,240
That's what we need to do.

109
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,400
And this is why we are using promise now it is kind of a problem because whenever we get this you know

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,040
we get the players we can set the State of the new players store the oldest of players here.

111
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,290
But all of this requests you know the storage getting the image they're going to take awhile.

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,260
They're going to take like two seconds or maybe more or maybe less.

113
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't know.

114
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,350
Depending on the server.

115
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,760
So if we set the stage before we have the images ready the application will break because we didn't

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,350
have an actual image.

117
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,160
You know we have this fake name.

118
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,750
So again we will use a promise.

119
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,970
What are we going to do.

120
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,730
It's something pretty standard.

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,230
Maybe you're not so kind of cool.

122
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:43,820
So I'm going to create a viral called Promises and it will be a lot of promises is going to start as

123
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,380
an empty array.

124
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,070
So what I'm going to do I'm going to loop through all the players so I'm going to say for open and close

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:00,070
and for each key so that key players begin to do something right.

126
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,720
OK.

127
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:07,430
And what I want to do I want to create a new promise and push it inside promises just like this.

128
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,520
So I'm going to say promise says Dad push push open it close.

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:23,200
Now inside of each push what we will push is a new promise and has to be with a capital P.

130
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,580
So what we going to be doing is for each player we're going to create in New Promise we're going to

131
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:36,010
make a request to the server bring the download your L for that player for each player and we're going

132
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,310
to push up promise we reject and we solve to the promises.

133
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,910
Right.

134
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:47,290
So at the end whenever this is done we can have an array with promises with 20 different promises.

135
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,470
And if you don't know how promises works after we get the download you are l.

136
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,050
We can call we can call to something right here.

137
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,520
We're going to be using it called we solved or reject.

138
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,620
So whenever we called we solved that promise inside the array will be resolved.

139
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,380
So be.

140
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:12,110
And when we get all the images from the server we begin to get an array with promises with 20 promises

141
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:20,540
with resolved promises and only and only after all promises are resolved then we can update the state.

142
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,770
That's why we are doing this but we are not there yet.

143
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,970
So whenever we called we create a new promise.

144
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,180
Of course we have a resolve a state in a reject.

145
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,020
So of course the reject is when something goes wrong.

146
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,110
We call reject and the promise fails.

147
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,850
All right.

148
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,160
So what do we need to do now is to make a request to firebase.

149
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:50,230
So firebase Dodd we access the storage DOD we and the players just like with it before.

150
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,960
And then of course we grab that child and inside of the child we need to pass the you know the actual

151
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,740
image.

152
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,550
So we can access players.

153
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,970
The key of you know each iteration and and we're going to bring that image name.

154
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:12,320
And then of course we can get download your L and after this has happened and this happens the promise

155
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,600
is going to get resolved.

156
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,540
This promise the firebase not this promise.

157
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,380
So when does it get resolved.

158
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,510
We're going to get a U R L back.

159
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:30,460
So what we do we grab the L and we place the you are the image property we have inside players you know

160
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,190
the one with the static name and we replace that with the u r l.

161
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:43,760
So we say players opening close we get the key we access Oh I'm sorry we're going to do something else.

162
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,520
We're going to add a new property called your L because we might need the image name.

163
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,240
So instead of changing the image we will add a new property.

164
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,790
So for that I was sick thinking about something else.

165
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,650
And then of course this promise since we do have that we get the information and everything goes OK.

166
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,080
We need to tell this promise this one we have right here that everything went ok and then we want to

167
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,020
resolve it.

168
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,830
So at the very end we're going to say we solved.

169
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,150
And we need to put this out.

170
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,810
And of course resaw So this command for example this will resolve this promise.

171
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,220
So inside of the promises this promise will get resolved.

172
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,210
And of course this is going to happen 20 times until we get all the images and we insert all that you

173
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,680
are all the new keys.

174
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,140
Right.

175
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,950
OK.

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,880
Now of course nothing happened so far because the only thing we are doing is just resolving promises

177
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,100
in the inside of the promises.

178
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,850
All right.

179
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:49,510
So we know what we need to do we need to update the state until all the 20 promises that we will get

180
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,700
out of here are resolved.

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,980
So what we do are going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to use the key word promise.

182
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,930
This is a research keyword and I'm going to say until all promises are done we don't do NOT want to

183
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,920
move forward.

184
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,990
And of course we passed as an argument of promises.

185
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,160
And whenever all the promises gets resolved then we're going to do something.

186
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,330
So open it close and what we do with this we do this.

187
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:28,630
That said state opening close and we say that loading now it's false because low ducking no loading.

188
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,220
Sorry.

189
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,050
Loading.

190
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,240
Because now the promise it's resolved all promises are resolved.

191
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,400
We get all the time nails the thumbnails the images that you or else.

192
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,250
And of course we changed the loading and you know the players we have the list of the players so we

193
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,280
set it on strict.

194
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,700
So now we're going to do just to you know make sure we're going to go to the render console.

195
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,980
The blog does not state that players just don't check.

196
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:07,160
We get the correct URL or we are getting the URL at least and I know after a while the app the component

197
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,290
renders and we get the list of players.

198
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,570
And now we have a u r l with the you know the location for this and this is why we are not storing this

199
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:24,640
inside of the you know the the actual database document because it's a pretty long while.

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,180
All right.

201
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:32,360
So now we are ready to create the the right here the components the actual the HD mail which looks asexually

202
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:40,250
GSX to show all the different players of course we need to do a lot before we go there.

203
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,240
But now at least we have a list of players.

204
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:53,180
So first I'm going to go to the main div class name open and close and I get to say the team container.

205
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,400
This is a class I created for this one and I'm going to add some stylings.

206
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,710
Remember that we have that striae background.

207
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,320
So I'm going to say style opening close.

208
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:10,970
And going to change the background to Dodd you are an L opening close and I'm going to be passing the

209
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,930
stripes we have on the top stripe.

210
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,630
No stripes.

211
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,550
And of course we need the repeat and this goes after repeat.

212
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,570
All right very good.

213
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,530
So of course we get it.

214
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,570
You know I've added to that container a min height.

215
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,900
So that's why we get it.

216
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,300
Burguet we are on the good track now of course we want to show the contents right here only if loading.

217
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,150
It's false.

218
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,800
OK so close and we say we want to own the show whenever it's inside of here.

219
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,390
After the loading.

220
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,210
All right.

221
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,640
If not of course we could show something else maybe a progress or whatever.

222
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
In this case we're going to keep it simple and do.

223
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,600
No.

224
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,540
All right.

225
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,890
Now it's out of here.

226
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,260
I will return a div and he's out of here.

227
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,680
Something else.

228
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,640
Now if you notice whenever we get the data from the database we get a pretty large list right.

229
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,300
OK.

230
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,140
And we don't know.

231
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,970
We don't have maybe four different lists.

232
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,250
We have just one.

233
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,600
For all the players.

234
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,050
And if you check it right here we need to render a piece for the keepers a piece for two different deal.

235
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,570
The difference then midfielder's and then attack.

236
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:39,080
So we kind of had we have four different modules and but we have one list.

237
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,300
So we need something or we need a function or something that it's going to split and show Cester keepers

238
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,090
on this block and maybe show the defense on the other block.

239
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,550
All right.

240
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,740
And that's what we're going to do right now.

241
00:15:51,750 --> 00:16:02,310
So first I'm going to create a div div opening close and distinct will contain a class name of team

242
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,180
underscore team underscore category.

243
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,600
Underscore wrapper.

244
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,440
I hope the name of the classmate makes sense to you.

245
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,250
They do make sense to me.

246
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,020
So class name I get at this.

247
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,260
And now I'm going to add the title now for each title for each block.

248
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,030
We have a title keeper's defense midfield and strikers.

249
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,770
So the first one will be keepers.

250
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,320
Right.

251
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,300
And inside of there we need to push to carts we need to put all the cards.

252
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:44,410
So I'm going to create a div with the class name of team cards right now instead of here.

253
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,850
We could have one card or we can have many cards.

254
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,530
So we need to grab we need to create a function that is going to be grabbing the cards.

255
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,750
There are lots of players and you know showing the cards.

256
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,920
So I'm going to call this that show players could be just like this.

257
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:09,750
Players and then by category because this is what this function is going to do it's going to show the

258
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,510
players only by category.

259
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,120
And as an only argument going to be passing which category in this case I'm going to show the keepers

260
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:26,360
and I'm using this keyword because on the database we have this Keyworth and it has to be the same key

261
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,380
word for keepers.

262
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,600
We are using keeper.

263
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,980
So if you make a mistake here will not recognize the category inside the list of players and nothing

264
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,590
is going to work.

265
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:43,100
So we don't have the function you can to create the function just like this.

266
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,990
Now what we need to return is GSX.

267
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:52,520
So instead of curly braces parenthesis and then on each iteration.

268
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,870
I'm sorry whenever we call this function it's category going to get a category Breguet.

269
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,490
So now we need to make sure that we do have a list of players.

270
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,540
So this state that players just like this opening close if we don't have it we're going to return.

271
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,190
No.

272
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:18,510
So now what we want to do we want to we want to map the list of players and return only the ones inside

273
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,630
that category.

274
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:30,270
So there's that state that players that map opening close on each iteration we will pass a player iteration

275
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,460
which is the index.

276
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,320
And then of course we will run a function.

277
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,110
And what we will do we will return something.

278
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,490
Notice that right here I'm not using parenthesis just a new basis.

279
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,910
That's why we need to return.

280
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,290
And I'm doing this because we need to perform a check right here.

281
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:57,480
We only want to return if the player that position it's equal to whatever category we have from the

282
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,550
arguments.

283
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,830
And of course if there's a match we will return something.

284
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,710
If not we're going to return NULL.

285
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,660
So what are you going to do right here.

286
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,550
I get a return of fate.

287
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,610
Remember we are using fade from Briac reveal and I want to fade it from the left.

288
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,030
Of course we need a key and the key is going to be.

289
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,800
I you know I'm using the iteration right here instead of here.

290
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,780
When you get to do are going to use div and are going to add a class name and a class name it's item

291
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,620
and he out of here we need to return the card.

292
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,880
You know the player card.

293
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,850
And at the top we are using the player card we are importing.

294
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,130
So I'm just going to use that we use this at home.

295
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,320
So it was kind of a while ago.

296
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,420
So this card of course needs some props.

297
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,140
It's the number of the player just like this needs the name of the player needs the last name of the

298
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,170
player.

299
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,830
And of course the background image of the player.

300
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:08,390
And we got we got all the information inside players so player that number than player doesn't name

301
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,320
the player.

302
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:18,060
Dodd last name and Dukes it sounds sounded like a song and played that and you are Al.

303
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,970
OK.

304
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,690
So OK.

305
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,690
So we pretty much have everything.

306
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:29,650
So if we go to our application we get a man.

307
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,550
All right.

308
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,560
So you know the transition it's a little bit weird.

309
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,400
Everything slides up.

310
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,740
Kevin the same you know I kind of don't like it.

311
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,550
And before I go to the final one you know the last one the recision is a little bit different.

312
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,800
Notice this we have you on the keepers.

313
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:56,600
We cannot tell the difference but on the on the rest notice that the transition is a little bit different.

314
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:06,540
So when I did I added a delay delay opening close and it added a delay of 20.

315
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,770
Now why 20.

316
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:14,220
And it's because I did and I grabbed the iteration number and it did a multiplication so on each fade

317
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,290
the delay is going to be a little bit different going to be a different number.

318
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,900
That's why we get a difference on the transitions.

319
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:27,050
So of course if I save this and we go back oops let's go back.

320
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,790
We get you know a the decision is a little bit different.

321
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:41,200
Of course we can exaggerate as much much more everything is going to be the same results going to take

322
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,520
more time.

323
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,910
We know that it is a little bit different.

324
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,570
So like 20 so I'm going to leave it at 20.

325
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,770
So we are pretty much done.

326
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:55,130
The only thing we need to do right now to finish this component is to create the defense the midfield

327
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,180
and then of course the attack.

328
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:07,880
So this case is going to be defense and the name but the contemporary defense the fans I'll write the

329
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,390
next one.

330
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,590
It's the mid field.

331
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:19,390
So we're going to go right here meet field and right here mid field and the next one our district is

332
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,010
so dry Kerr's

333
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,580
strikers and this is Singler striker.

334
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,590
All right.

335
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,090
Now make sure that the different categories are the same.

336
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,070
Same you have inside here.

337
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,780
So of course if you go get difference we get midfield right.

338
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:52,980
Everything works and we get strikers and notice that I'm getting the up the images of the players because

339
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,910
I of course took the liberty of going to the our database the ones for this project not the one I had

340
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,580
ready and enter all the names and you know all the all the actual images I have replaced all the images

341
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:13,190
with real images and they are stored inside our storage is so very good.

342
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,530
The team is ready.

343
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,110
We're going to give you a zip code of this and now we're going to do the matches.

344
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,110
The mattress is going to be a little bit different.

345
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,440
It's going to take us a little bit more time because even though we fetch lots of teams and we showed

346
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,330
this we have this at the top so we need to create some functions to do some filtering.

347
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,030
All right.

348
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,390
So let's go to the next section and do the matches.

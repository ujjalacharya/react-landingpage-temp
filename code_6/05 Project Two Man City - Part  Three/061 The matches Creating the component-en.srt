1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,610
OK so let's create the matchups and point.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,590
So at the end we're going to get this.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,100
So on this we have three different parts.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,170
We have the part of the top which are the filters we're going to do to fit two to two filters and they

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:21,540
will be really simple because on the next project we will be creating a Web site and we have a big filter's

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,020
section.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,150
So we're going to go hardcore on that one.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,540
And then in the left you have a league table which is actually fake and in the real left of course right

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,700
here on the bottom this is what we're going to be doing you know getting getting the matches and doing

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,620
all the logic of this and the league table I'm going to tell you what to do in a minute.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,260
So first of course to create this we have a route we need to create a route and a component to work

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,000
with this.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,460
So I'm going to go to components and inside of components what we can do is create a new directory called

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,380
the matches.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,190
The other one was the team so this one is the matchups.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,740
So instead of the matches we have three parts first the index that G-S them we're going to get a different

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,540
part which is the Imagist list.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,720
So matches and then list that James and then we have the table and I'm going to tell you what to do

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,170
on the table later.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,970
Now on this one the index will be getting a re-act classic ways component just like this.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,640
And of course this one will be called the matches.

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,400
The matches.

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,460
Now I'm going to paste this.

24
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,480
I'm going to say the matches.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,920
So let's inport this is to create a round for this element for the matches.

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,370
So I'm going to go two routes and this would be a public route so import the mattress.

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,620
Let me do it right from.

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,320
And of course for Slash components for Slash the matches.

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,830
All right.

30
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,470
Since we have an index we don't need to put in x.

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,370
Now of course this will be a public route.

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,910
So just like the team I'm going to copy this route.

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:14,430
Copy and paste it right here the top when it closes and I'm going to bring the matches from the mattress

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,280
and right here the route.

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,620
It's a little bit different.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,090
I believe we're going to be using the team I'm sorry the matches you know the same thing.

37
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,130
The matches right now in theory the application reloads.

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,370
If I bring the console we should be getting at least a div saying matches right.

39
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,750
Just like with it before.

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,620
So we get the matches get.

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,170
OK.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,770
So let's go to the mattress.

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm going to close the team and I'm going to use it and pass it to Jason goodbye and look up the side

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,240
of the index.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,500
We need to start requiring to importing a few things.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
We're going to use a progress.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:06,270
So import circular circular and then progress and we need to import it from act mature and UI core and

48
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,040
then Tsukuba our progress whatever.

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,210
Now we will need to do some medical requests to the database to firebase.

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:23,430
So import opening close and five days just like this and then matches we're going to use them and then

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:33,240
from that force slash that that force slash then one more and firebase get one last thing to do import

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,250
we need to firebase Luper.

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,680
You always need to firebase Looper.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:49,110
So labor and are going to bring the reverse array reverse reverse array every time I say rebirths I

55
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:58,110
just remember the BDO from the guy from a guy saying rebirths Antti you know the woman that was driving

56
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,690
and trying to park the car.

57
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,800
Very funny to look on that on YouTube.

58
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:12,150
Rebirths aunty just like this just just looked at reverse reverse of course Antti and you can see a

59
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,190
very funny video.

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,470
So now of course we have the matches list.

61
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,170
I'm not getting imported right now.

62
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,860
We're going to do it in a couple minutes.

63
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,520
So of course this one will need to use the state because we need to do all the network requests and

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,910
we will need to store them inside of here.

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,580
First I'm going to do a loading could be loading or loading.

66
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,560
Doesn't matter it's completely up to you after we get the mattress are going to store them inside of

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,610
an array.

68
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,480
All right.

69
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,500
Now later we're going to be filtering the matches.

70
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,230
So this is actually you can choose how to do it.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,570
You can manage the whole match just inside the magic list.

72
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,890
But I'm going to do it on the pound component so whenever I load the matches from firebase I going to

73
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,070
store the unmodified list inside matches.

74
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,210
And then when we start filtering we will use the filter matches to store the filtered matches because

75
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,090
we may be.

76
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:13,670
And we might get just two matches and by storing them here we are not modifying the one on the top.

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,820
That's why we do it.

78
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,010
And again you could do it whatever you want right here.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,340
Player filter and this one right now makes no sense.

80
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,890
I'm just going to add it and then we're going to go back to this and then resold.

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,750
And this one actually something for the.

82
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,320
So resoled filter.

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,430
And again I'm going to say all we're going to go back to this.

84
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,260
Don't worry.

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,080
OK.

86
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,500
So now before I do anything I would like to fetch.

87
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,370
Fetch the list of matches from the server.

88
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:50,830
So firebase Oh sorry component that Mount opening close and firebase matches.

89
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,470
We do the ones we do the value and then of course we get our our promise.

90
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,360
So we're going to get a snapshot.

91
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,990
And after we do that which is run and then Konst and they're going to store the matches and remember

92
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,630
that we need to use the foreign based Luper with whatever snapshot we get back from the server.

93
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,460
All right.

94
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,290
So close.

95
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,000
OK.

96
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,690
So now since we have the matches I want to store the matches inside filter matches so I'm going to say

97
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:28,810
this that state this that sets stayed open and close and bloating.

98
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:35,780
Since we have all the information now it's going to be false then the matches are going to store with

99
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,480
the reversal rate and going to reverse everything.

100
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,720
So I go and grab matches and pass the reverse array and the same thing with the filtered matches right

101
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
here.

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,170
They're going to store the pretty much the same thing.

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:55,620
Then of course it changes whenever we select a filter or we start filtering that list it's going to

104
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,870
change a little bit.

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,890
OK.

106
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,350
So we promote much have anything I'm going to do comes along and just make sure that we have this state

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,700
and you know the matches make sure we get everything and we don't get any surprises later.

108
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,190
So if filter matches and matches Breguet same result.

109
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,090
All right.

110
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,410
So now of course we need to show something maybe a loader if it's loading and remove it.

111
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,700
Of course when it's done loading.

112
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:30,870
So first we need to create and close you know to create the basic layout for this.

113
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:38,250
So class name is going to be the underscore match's underscore container.

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,480
We're going to do one more thing first we're going to say Konst state equals to this state.

115
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,860
We're going to be referring to this that state many many times inside of here and in a few and a few

116
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,500
minutes.

117
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,620
So by doing this I'm just storing this in a state in state of state.

118
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,960
So now instead of referring to this that state I just can say state right makes sense.

119
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,580
We do this all the whole time.

120
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:10,890
So Dave open it close and I'm going to wrap everything inside of a wrapper so the mattress matches underscore

121
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,510
wrapper.

122
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,370
All right.

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,340
Very good.

124
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,710
Now if we take a look at the original you know the final one we have a left side and right side.

125
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,570
So I'm going to rob we're going to create a div with the left.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:33,580
So class name and this one is going to be left and the other one would be left as left of course.

127
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,310
Now Sorry it's going to be right.

128
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,860
So I am just joking.

129
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,480
OK.

130
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,250
So we have a left and we have a right side.

131
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,600
So in the left and I'm starting the ride we're going to get the league table.

132
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,250
Now I don't want to show you how to create the table because it's just fake information.

133
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:58,200
If we go to the database and I go to positions we just you know have all the teams with the how many

134
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,160
draws how many wands.

135
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,120
And you know the points and everything else.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,840
Now why are we are we not doing this.

137
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:15,040
And it is because I've worked in a company called Starts with an F O and ends with an X and then sports.

138
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,350
And I've worked with E S and then and when the P and Anantapur.

139
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:27,210
So I work for both companies so I know a little bit about you know web pages or you know apps or whatever

140
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,530
that they got to do with sports.

141
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,860
Now what companies do they they don't enter the information manually.

142
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,010
They don't have people doing this.

143
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,190
What they do they hire a service and this service of course they have people or maybe people are maybe

144
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,390
not trained monkeys or something like that.

145
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,380
Entering information about the magic maybe Manchester City is playing the game right now.

146
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,760
So there's a guy entering the information live.

147
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,310
And of course they use these companies they hire this service and they consume an API.

148
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,830
So what we're doing right here with the games actually in real life doesn't happen.

149
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,970
I just really we are doing it because of course we are practicing.

150
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,090
But in real life they hire a service and they consume their API.

151
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,910
And the same thing with the league table.

152
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:25,110
If we had to create a part of the application just to create a table and all the logic of positioning

153
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:32,550
the teams with the goals in favor and goals against and local the wins and way wins it would be very

154
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,580
very very long and not very useful because you can only apply it to a league table or something.

155
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,850
And the rules might change with each sport in soccer or football.

156
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,700
They are one way maybe on the NBA they are different.

157
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:53,940
So again no no makes no sense to just create a section to do a league table.

158
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,930
So what Im going to do as a resource.

159
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,030
I've added the file I have inside of here.

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,810
Right.

161
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,050
The final file calls table that J.S. just download the resource just download the file and put it inside

162
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,210
of the matches.

163
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,820
Right.

164
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,320
And of course make sure that all the imports and everything is correct.

165
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,720
If you did it this way maybe you changed some names and something's not going to work.

166
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,060
So check the console and and make sure what it's wrong.

167
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,190
So I'm going to do that are going to puzzle BDO you bring the file right here and then I'm going to

168
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,460
connect to it and show it.

169
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,180
OK I've imported the file and it's you know really simple as just a table.

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,060
It's consuming it's bringing from the database to positions and then of course we just loop the table

171
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,120
rows inside of a table.

172
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,340
So so simple and we kind of already did this.

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,840
So I'm going to go to index going to go at the top.

174
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,060
And of course we need to import league table.

175
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,680
So import league table.

176
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,610
Right.

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,690
And it's going to be from dot dot for Slash and then table.

178
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,850
Right.

179
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,930
So link table are going to go right here at the bottom and the only thing we need to do is just import

180
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,570
it.

181
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,600
Now of course I didn't try this time right now.

182
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,080
So ok we get the league table.

183
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,610
That is good.

184
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,570
So you should be getting the same thing.

185
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:14,890
All right.

186
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,100
So let's go back to our project.

187
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,000
So in the left in the left side is where are we going to be working on the left what we got.

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,570
First are some match filters which are the ones at the top.

189
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,120
And we're going to do that last.

190
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,320
You're going to do that last but I'm going to create the container for this right now.

191
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,720
So we add a class name and the class name is match just like this match.

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,370
And then filter's right now inside of the filters we pretty much have two boxes.

193
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,170
So we will create the boxes later.

194
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,920
So I'm going to say boxes sorry of course it's not javascript.

195
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,730
OK.

196
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,620
So it's after the filter is what we need to do we need to bring the matches.

197
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,450
So this file.

198
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,190
All right.

199
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,080
So of course we don't have anything right here.

200
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,590
Let me create at least a class inside the matches list because we will need a class.

201
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:18,980
So re-act classmates component just like this and this one will be called match's list right here.

202
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,930
And of course a list.

203
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,680
OK.

204
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,840
So he's out of here.

205
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,530
We need to import it.

206
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:37,730
So import then matches list matches and then list from that for Slash and matches list and a copy.

207
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,140
And I'm going to go right here at the bottom.

208
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:47,100
So this match list pretty much needs and actually needs the information about the matches the information

209
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,390
we are fetching right here from the server.

210
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:56,440
So when we make our way when we import we actually make a reference to this component to say matches

211
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,690
list and begin to pass the prop and the probably matches something like that can open in clubs.

212
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,990
Can I say this.

213
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Actually there's no need we can say state DOT and then filter matches.

214
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,580
Now one of my passing I'm passing the information about filter matches this one not the original.

215
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,240
Right.

216
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,990
OK.

217
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,830
So inside the matches list we will do all the logic right here.

218
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,990
So let me just those.

219
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,090
Don't check on our project that we are getting list and we do OK.

220
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,710
We are getting a list.

221
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:38,730
So now what we are going to be doing we are going to be looping this list and we can be using node group

222
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:45,600
now no group comes from re-act move from IMR we installed re-act move going to bring We asked move.

223
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,760
And with this this property what you can do you can you can actually do something else and the animate

224
00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,190
that weve been doing this not group me trying to find the live examples and code.

225
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,830
All right.

226
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Going to give you a little bit tiny overview to this.

227
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,190
And then of course you get into it.

228
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,460
So okay so more examples documentation no break here.

229
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,760
If I go to note group what we do is something like this.

230
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,560
Notice that of course this is a list just a list.

231
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,940
And when we animate it is going to change the position and the positions on that list.

232
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,590
So maybe a is going to go to a different place and you know its pretty much changing the order on the

233
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,760
list.

234
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,770
Now for this and this is actually what were beginning to be needing later when whenever we filter the

235
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:42,330
information right here this list is going to change instead of maybe having 10 we can have a 5.

236
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,660
So react move by using this node group.

237
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,860
What it does is going to is going to store the old list.

238
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,600
Its going to be getting a new list and its kind of merge both.

239
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,900
And when it's doing that is going to generate an animation on that and that particular list.

240
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,290
So this is what we're going to be using right.

241
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,350
We're going to be doing whenever we alter the list node group we'll check which ones has to go have

242
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,860
to go and which ones are going in.

243
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,900
As we ran out at all.

244
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,620
And then if I check it we can just maybe four or maybe two.

245
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,810
Now the list of course now has two elements.

246
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:27,730
We don't have all the 20 matches we just have two but no group removes the ones that are not in that

247
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,650
list and entering the one that we have a Belva right now.

248
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,940
So that's why we need to use note group by doing this just just with animations with the animation we've

249
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,550
been using with re-act move.

250
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,040
Could be a little bit a little bit challenging.

251
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,790
All right.

252
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,420
So on the mattress list we're going to leave the live this at least ready to go.

253
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,310
I'm going to say state opening close and I'm going to store the mattress list inside of here.

254
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:03,550
Now the thing is that if I do do a console console log with this that prompts the first time that this

255
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,240
loads

256
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,450
we don't have anything.

257
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,000
So if we trigger something with an empty array or empty an empty list and something with an empty animation

258
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,370
it could fail.

259
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,700
So what we can do we can use that get the right state from props to do something simple.

260
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,670
You know you shouldn't use get the right state from prompts to do a lot of things you can use it the

261
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,390
whole time.

262
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,100
It's just for tiny things.

263
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:37,920
So when you begin to be doing is we can be catching the promp the props the coma the state and we will

264
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,170
we will be returning return.

265
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:47,190
We always need to return something the state with the actual Just list with whatever we have inside

266
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,090
the probs.

267
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,200
If we of course we get it we get some information Propp that matches.

268
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,080
And this of course will grab whatever we get from matches and it will tacet inside matches list.

269
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,700
So later what we can do we can check if we do have matches list.

270
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,300
And of course run whatever we want to run.

271
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,260
All right.

272
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,200
Now let's go to the next one because what we're going to be doing.

273
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,130
It's a lot of you know with a node group with the animation so we do all we need to do quite some coding.

274
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,980
So let's go to the next one and start this one.

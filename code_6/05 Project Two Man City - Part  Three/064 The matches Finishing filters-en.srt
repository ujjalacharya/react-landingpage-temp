1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,500
All right so let's finish this.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,070
I'm going to add the classes and then add the other one which is pretty much the same code.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,950
So we're going to do a little bit of copy pasting.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,440
I want to fix something right here.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,930
It's not play or filter is going to be played.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,710
Filter sorry for that.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,720
So we just made a reference right there too.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,230
OK.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,210
So that is good.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,170
So OK.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,070
I'm going to go right here and use a turn.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,040
So opening close.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:39,020
Going to say state DOT played filter then if this one is triple equal to all Barens simple I'm going

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,040
to show something.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,020
If not I'm going to show nothing.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,710
So what I want to show is the active or I want to show nothing.

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,440
All right.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,880
And the same thing for the other one's going to copy.

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,320
This one's going to paste it and paste it.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,050
And this one instead of all is going to be yes and this one will be.

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,060
No no.

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,630
There we go.

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,370
So if I reload the application OK we get all because the default scenario is 0.

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,570
And if I go to played we get played and not played.

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,700
We get not play very good.

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,100
Now that works.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,070
Now we need to prove we are pretty much do the same thing for the results filter.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:25,340
So I'm going to copy this instance of match filter's box and I'm going a pace that right here.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,410
And of course we need to change that tack with resolved and then game OK.

30
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:41,330
So of course we need to make a new function called result called assault and result.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,640
Now of course right here it's a little bit different.

32
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,760
We have all four to the fold case.

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,440
Then instead of yes we have double checked the database.

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
These are the wins.

35
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:59,770
So I'm going to say Davola you then we have to lose the losses so we can say well and they're going

36
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,360
to create a new one copy paste.

37
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,140
And this one is going to be the draw right.

38
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,550
Of course we are not going to make a reference to a plate filter.

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,660
We will make a reference to resolved filter result.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,490
Filter get a copy and replace the other ones.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,190
And if I if I check it at least we should be getting something here now going to work.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,220
But we're going to get it.

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,610
OK.

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,170
That is good.

45
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,190
So I'm going to go back and now we're going to be passing to show we're sold.

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,100
Win lose draw or.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,900
All right.

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,190
We didn't have this function.

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,010
I going to go right here at the top and this function calls show we solved it calls played open and

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,530
close again.

51
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,990
We will be receiving some arguments in this case is just a result and what we need to do is the same

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,780
thing than this.

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,870
So we could just create one function and you know do everything in one function.

54
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,080
But again we are almost almost there.

55
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:04,870
So we get a state matches going a filter and we're going to check the result so instead of final is

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,700
going to be really soft.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Right and whatever we're going to be checking all begin filtering all the the rissoles that matches

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,850
the argument right.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,820
All right so the filter matches instead of played.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,150
It's going to be result.

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,210
And again we get if we get all we just returned the normal array of matches the one that has all the

62
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,870
matches.

63
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,480
If not we returned the list and same thing with right here with the result filter.

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,140
So we're sulfurous or we do the opposite.

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,320
We return result.

66
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,740
If not we can reset all the one to all.

67
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,380
So we are doing the same thing here but backwards.

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,090
All right.

69
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,950
Real simple.

70
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,350
So if I go to when we get all the wins.

71
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,330
All right.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,480
I go to lose.

73
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,160
We get all the lose and the draw Burguet.

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,330
And if I go to played.

75
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,190
All right let's get this one not working properly.

76
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,160
Maybe I made a mistake.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,370
Just let me double check why I'm going to go right here.

78
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,520
And it's because we didn't change this.

79
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,750
This one of course uses different arguments.

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:22,340
So this one is going to be when this one is going to be loose and this draw now should be Morgan.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,700
All right.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,620
Win lose draw and all.

83
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,990
And if I go here and suck something it will reset everything Burguet.

84
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,780
So this is the final.

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,520
It works.

86
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,370
So now the next section will do something very very very simple.

87
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:46,570
I'm going to sip the code for this one so find it as a download as a resource and begin to do the not

88
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,130
found.

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,330
And then we will send everything to the hosting.

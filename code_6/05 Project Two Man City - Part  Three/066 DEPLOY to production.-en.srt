1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:09,430
OK so we need to build our project to create a build of our project and host it inside of our base.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,470
First we need to make some changes.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:21,270
If I go to database right here inside our project it's going to take a little while.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:30,640
So if we go to our project and I go to rules the rules say say that anyone can read and anyone can write.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,700
So anyone can enter to you know our obligation get the keys and everything else.

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,560
And of course they will start writing so anyone can write.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,330
But we don't want to do this.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,540
We want only authenticated users to right to our application.

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,520
Makes sense.

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,770
So we need to change this a little bit instead of true.

11
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,930
Everyone can read that's cool but on right we're going to change this.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,580
So I'm going to do this.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,110
I'm going to open and see if I can make this bigger or go a little bigger.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,930
And I got to say OK if our love is different than Nouel so only users which are authenticated which

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,060
different dental can right now we have one problem.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,810
If you go to our application and I go to home I scroll down and we have one part where anyone can read

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,220
to our database because any user should be able any actually.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,800
Any user should be able to enter the e-mail right here and right to our database.

19
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,290
So we need to write a special rule for e-mail.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:34,870
OK.

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,530
So I'm going to go back here.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,430
So the Partan database where are we going to be hosting this promotions.

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,880
You know these emails calls promotions that is the name of the document.

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:55,160
So I'm going to say OK I want to do this for pretty much everything but for promotions promotions I

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,990
want to do something else so I pass an object in promotions.

26
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,230
Anyone can read.

27
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,720
So I need to do dot read.

28
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,380
And then Con and true and then coma and anyone can write.

29
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,940
So dot right.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,100
CONAN And then true.

31
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,240
All right.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,230
And I'm going to publish this.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,000
And there we go.

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,320
They are published and they're going to make this back to the fold.

35
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,650
So now not anyone can anyone can read but not anyone can write.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,620
But inside promotion's anyone can read and anyone can write.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,410
So if I overload the application I go to enter email and of course this email is already on the list

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
going to type whatever.

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,130
And then gmail dot com and I'm going to enroll and it's letting us do it.

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,760
And the same thing happens right now with storage.

41
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,060
If I go to storage

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
Let's wait for it.

43
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,100
We have the players benefit but if I go to rules anyone can read and anyone can write.

44
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,050
So a loud read a request out is different to No.

45
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,060
Oh no sorry.

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,630
It's by default.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,730
You know and anyone can read.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,960
Anyone can read but not anyone could write.

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,700
OK.

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,320
So this is good you know this is actually correct.

51
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,310
OK.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,890
So we're good to go.

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:28,360
Now how where we can find information in how to host our project inside the inside firebase so I'm going

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,650
to click and get started and right here they say NPM install G tools.

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,150
I'm going to cancel for this.

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,790
I'm going to go to the QuickStart.

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,050
So this is the docs.

58
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,350
It's inside firebase docs hosting hosting and then QuickStart.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,140
So this are all the instructions.

60
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,100
It's going to be really really simple.

61
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,430
So first we need to install the firebase tools I've already have this but I'm going to install it anyways

62
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,100
so it's going to go to the terminal.

63
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,130
I'm going to quit the process and I'm going to clear now before we can put anything inside firebase.

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,830
All right.

65
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,490
We need to create it we can not put this project inside firebase because our base is for you know putting

66
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,690
up simple apps right here right here.

67
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,500
So we cannot we cannot just put whatever we want.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,500
We need to create the belt first.

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,050
All right.

70
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,940
So I'm going to go to M city and if we go to PAX to Jason here you have the commands to create a built.

71
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,810
So it's NPM run build or in this case.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,690
I'm using John Ron built in a press center.

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,270
It's going to create a build going to take a few seconds and I'll be right back.

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,080
OK so everything was built.

75
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,910
If I go to my directory I have the build.

76
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,660
Right.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,540
Right here.

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
Very good.

79
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,340
It comes in.

80
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,610
So now what do we need to do.

81
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,460
We to install the tools from firebase so we can push this to hosting.

82
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,120
We need to do NPM install global Firebrace tools.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm using yarned but I don't know if you know this will work with yarn so I'm just going to do and PM

84
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,530
NPM install says you have node by default you have and PM So it's going to work for sure.

85
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,770
Right.

86
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,150
It's going to take a second and I'll be right back.

87
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,750
OK so everything was installed going into to clear.

88
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,860
Now notice that we are doing minus g so this will install far base globally.

89
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,570
We are not installing this inside our project.

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,430
So we are installing this in our computer.

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:38,440
So whenever we want to do I want to use a command from firebase we can do it and we don't need to install

92
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,830
everything again.

93
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,810
All right.

94
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,380
All right.

95
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,600
Clear.

96
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,280
So now the first step would be to do firebase log in in order to you know create a fire base project

97
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,860
or hosting right here we need to loggin.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,350
I'm already logged in but I'm going to do it anyways.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Firebase log in and it's going to ask you something.

100
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,030
In my case I'm already logged in.

101
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,220
But in your case if you're not Logan is going to say please log in.

102
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,330
Just enter your username from firebase and the password.

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,920
Now how can we initialize this.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,930
So right here.

105
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,850
The third step.

106
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,100
It's initialized your side.

107
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,140
So we need to do firebase innit.

108
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,090
So I'm going to do firebase in net and now you need to be careful you're going to get this you're going

109
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,180
to get a bunch of functions and the one we need to use is the one that says hosts hosting now don't

110
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,730
press anything so far yet is going to say do you want to set up this folder or press space to select

111
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,040
features then enter to confirm.

112
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,120
So inside hosting what do we need to do.

113
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,800
I need to press space just like hostessing and then enter and the set up will begin.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,260
So let's give it a minute.

115
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,560
It's going to give you some some options.

116
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,520
Select a default bar based project for this directory.

117
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,830
So right here it's going to give you the options of which project you want to use.

118
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm using the m city.

119
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,270
I have three projects and we put four inside firebase.

120
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,890
So I'm going to select am City so am City.

121
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,650
So what do you want to use as your public direct directory.

122
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,070
So by default as public as this one.

123
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,200
But we don't want that.

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,680
We want to use the built.

125
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,500
So in this case I need to specify the building.

126
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,770
That's why we did it.

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,940
So I'm going to say Build Now it can say configure as a single page app.

128
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,000
Well yes we are using as a single page app.

129
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,940
So when you say yes.

130
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,790
So the next question is going to be file index HVM l already accessed.

131
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,950
So yeah inside built we already have an index that HVM L.

132
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:53,070
Now if you click yes it will pretty much override whatever it's inside the shemale and they will put

133
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,830
their code and we don't want that our HCM L comes from re-act from built.

134
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,400
So that's the one we need.

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,040
So we're going to say no.

136
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,470
All right.

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,430
And that is that is going to pretty much created a Jeff firebase the Jason File.

138
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,290
We are not pushing didn't push anything so far but is going to create a file where you know it's going

139
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,040
to put everything is going to take all these instructions and deploy it to hosting.

140
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,390
So now the next step is one.

141
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,090
It's not the one we already did this one.

142
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:31,930
We need to deploy your site so firebase deploy firebase and then deploy a presenter.

143
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:39,750
It's going to take a second and that is it when it's done it will give you the project console and hosting

144
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,410
you or else.

145
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,330
So if I copy the hosting your L and pasted right here are the top

146
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,430
you're going to get our project.

147
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,220
So everything works right.

148
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,730
And if we are even getting things from the database with the players and you know this works.

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,370
All right.

150
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,060
OK.

151
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,410
So what happens if I try to authenticate it.

152
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:11,960
I believe in our project the route was signed and so going to go to sign in and I believe and I don't

153
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
remember right now.

154
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,530
Oh right here of deployment history you get the of course the dash forward of all the deployments.

155
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,600
If I go to a indication I was using Francis at gmail.

156
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,240
Weird.

157
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,340
So Francis Jamail and then I believe password one two three.

158
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,910
So if I log in.

159
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,940
All right.

160
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,650
It's Ilet letting us log in matches players.

161
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,820
So there we go.

162
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,500
OK.

163
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,110
So this is the last thing we're going to do for this project.

164
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,420
We're going to move on.

165
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,710
We're going to move on to the next and the third and final project maybe it's going to be pretty long

166
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,090
but we can do a lot of things.

167
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,130
So so complete.

168
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,160
And for this one.

169
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,700
After the course it's done I am done publishing this course.

170
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:06,800
I get to you know stop 3:55 for a few days and think what I can add to this project and I will add a

171
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,970
few bonus sections to each project maybe the second one and the third one because the first one it's

172
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,150
so simple.

173
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,960
So maybe I will try to add something for fun functions or maybe something with e-mails or something

174
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,360
like that going to add some bonus sections.

175
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:31,160
Now if you want and if you want you know if you can think of something for me to actually do right here

176
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,690
to add to this project you can just comment there and I'm going to read the comments.

177
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,950
All right.

178
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,340
OK.

179
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,310
So if you got this far congratulations.

180
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,730
It's not a super long web site but we kind of did a lot of things so there's a lot of logic right here.

181
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,300
So let's move to the next and final project.
